# Ash Lads - 1/29/26
(During a requested 1 on 1 walkabout, Joshua asked if he could hit record on his phone.)



**Joshua:** What you’ve built up over the years, your achievements, yeah. And I think the Buddha...

**Dr. J:** ...would agree that the attachment is so severe. But that’s—I think you’re also right—the reason we get attached is because we have something to lose. It’s because we think this is great, and we don’t want to die.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly. Sure.

**Joshua:** I’m trying to scour the depths of my mind to figure out why my reaction to you coming up to me just now was like that. There’s definitely some fear involved there. It’s like, I'm really defensive. I think maybe it has to do with the fact that I’m trying to figure things out on my own. I was trying to take the lead in the group because I felt like it was scattered.

**Dr. J:** Everything you’re saying makes sense, but...

**Joshua:** What? Of course, that’s... I don’t think that’s a good thing. Well...

**Dr. J:** What I see is... what you’re calling "scattered," I don’t think so. I’ve seen this happen other days with the group where they’re going back and forth, sinking into a place of a lot of depth on this issue. And then I see you kind of want to pull it back.

**Joshua:** Maybe, yeah.

**Dr. J:** What I’m thinking right now, especially as you're sharing with me, is that you might actually be scared of where that goes. Of that place of deepening—into this place of being face-to-face, wide-eyed with...

**Joshua:** I don’t see anything I’d be scared of if we do enter that space. I think the problem is I’m skipping a step. And that is, I’m skipping the step between "figuring it out" and actually creating the TMP \[Team Multimedia Presentation\]. Because that in-between space—that’s where everything happens. That in-between space is where we figure everything out, where we think, where we have conversations, where we create the foundation of the TMP. What I’m trying to skip to is just *creating* the TMP. I agree with Rush; I shouldn't be.

**Dr. J:** I agree with that. I think that’s true on an intellectual level, but I would also suggest that there might be an emotional level there, too. When you’re dealing with something like this—and it’s interesting because you keep talking about "presence," and that’s actually what we’re talking about now, too. Partly that’s intellectual—slowing down and being with the thoughts—but I honestly think there’s also something here about the dream that I was telling you about a little while ago.

Death came out of the woods, and I was face-to-face with Death. I actually had to just be there and be like, *"Is it time?"* And to be with the energy of death without reacting, without trying to get away, without trying to get anywhere—to actually just be in acceptance with it.

"Is it time?" "No, not yet. There’s someone I want you to meet." That actually introduced me to Jesus Christ, to the Christ energy. Which also, obviously, involves death. How do we connect with Christ? How does Christ connect with God? Through death. Through peace with death, acceptance of death.

And so, I think part of what’s presenting here is... like, it’s very human when Death comes to be like, "No!" and to jerk away from it. In a way, I think that’s part of what I’m representing in this scenario, because after seeing what was happening repeatedly, I kind of pierced it. I think that’s part of what’s happening here—a kind of learning, an initiation. This is the slowing down that has to happen before the conversation can begin.

**Joshua:** I was for a while, and now I’m realizing that’s still kind of there. I’ve had this second persona that’s over-confident. It tries not to be scared by suppressing it. During my mushroom trip, I didn’t even want to... I was so stuck. I couldn't get out. I was forced to spiral down into the depths of the human mind. I did not want that. To die... it's scary. I think that’s where my fear comes from.

**Dr. J:** That’s all the energy, yeah. That isn’t just dying. That whole underworld, that whole loss of control—everything you experienced in that trip—that’s all. When mature men experience the energy of death, they don’t say, "I’m not scared." They go [deep breath]... you know? The gods love to knock down someone in hubris.

**Joshua:** Yeah. Yeah, I need a… I don’t know. I think my difficulty is entering that space of vulnerability with my group.

**Dr. J:** You and your group chose to take this on, and I think it’s all happening as it’s meant to happen. For you to deepen in this way and deepen your maturity... you guys certainly didn't choose to take on a light, casual topic. No. So, what a beautiful thing that, as part of your project, you get to face that. That makes it real. It’s not just an idea; you’re actually living it. You’re experiencing the actual fact of what you’re advocating for. For humanity, if you think about it, you’re literally living the microcosm of your solution right now.

**Speaker 5:** Which is kind of cool. Yeah, exactly.

**Joshua:** It’s really something that I just need to surrender to.

**Dr. J:** Surrender is a huge part of it.

**Joshua:** Also surrendering to death. Exactly.

**Dr. J:** Mid-to-late 20s is when I started working on that...

**Joshua:** Yeah, I think that also ties in. There are so many people like you, my dad, many other people that I’ve talked to that have made such incredible and profound realizations about the world. I’ve had a lot of conversations with them, and it could get pretty overwhelming. So many people figure this out when they’re in their late 20s, in their 30s... even my dad figured out a lot of this in his 40s. He said his life has just started now, in his 40s. Some people don’t start working on this until they’re in their 80s.

And I think all this knowledge that I’m being presented with at such a young age has been a bit overwhelming in the past. But I also think it’s very beautiful, and it’s something that I really need to surrender to and make peace with.

**Dr. J:** Well, traditionally you’re not early. In a healthy traditional society, this is the right time for this. This would be the correct age for this type of initiation.

**Joshua:** Yeah, but I guess modern society has made that really difficult.

**Dr. J:** Well, modern society... I think it’s difficult in any society. I think a lot of what you’re experiencing is actually not "wrong" or "earliness," it’s just a natural intensity of this process. This process is always intense for anyone. This is actually the right age for it. If we remember in Martin Prechtel’s work, the young men would literally all go away for a year together to engage in this type of inner work and process with a couple of elders. Away from their families, they would go live together and engage. Part of what they did was process life and death. That was typically between 14 and 17 years old.

There was a tradition in Norse societies—the Vikings. There's a myth of a young person who crawled under a table at a certain point in their teenage years. They would literally crawl under the table and just curl up. The lore says the Vikings called them "Ash-lads" because they would get covered in soot from the fireplace and rub it on themselves. They would often stay there for a year. And this is what they were processing. They would just feel, at a certain point in their teenage years, they’d just be like, "F\*\*\* life." And the Norse would let them just crawl under the table and live there for a year. And then they’d come out and start being normal Vikings.

**Joshua:** That’s a huge problem in the modern world. People can’t be with themselves because of all the distractions: the religion of distraction, social media distraction, politics as distraction. It’s all propaganda. It’s like we are indirectly not allowed to do any of this. And when you do some of this, then you’re a "radical," you’re a "heretic."

**Dr. J:** Reminds me of what James Hillman said. One of Hillman’s quotes was: *"What we need in the world now is not heroes of the light. We need champions of descent—champions of going down into the dark to face ourselves."*

**Joshua:** We are so optimized to only think about what’s out there—what’s in outer space? What's going on in the news?

**Dr. J:** Exactly. And spirituality is related to this too, where it's like "elevate," "shine your light." That’s like extra-extra-extroverted. Like it’s not "real" spirituality unless you’re like *that*. But Hillman is saying, "F\*\*\* that." What we need is people who can go down and be real, stop performing, and stop trying to shine their light. But like, *be you*. Who are you really, without performance?

That’s also why people get really real when they get the news that they’re going to die. They stop performing. People don’t live their last six months being like "Love and Light." They live their last six months being like, "Okay, I’ve got to get really honest."

**Joshua:** Just this conversation alone, and being here... I wish everyone would be able to experience something like this.

**Dr. J:** Well, that’s what we might call an "initiatory conversation." But also, more broadly, what would it look like to live in an initiatory culture? A culture that faces the energy of death? Our avoidance of death has caused so many of our problems.

**Joshua:** I’m trying to figure out a way to put that into words that anyone would be able to understand. You can only get so far with language, and I think the key to it is just the experience. The key is the experience of vulnerability that people are so unfamiliar with. The experience of being in a space where you hold no power at all—not over yourself, or the others around you. Being humble.

**Dr. J:** The way you’re talking about it now feels more accurate than trying to give it a buzzword.

**Joshua:** Yeah, exactly. If anything, I should be thinking of the full picture and then think of a phrase that relates to all of that. That would be the step after I actually think about it, instead of doing it the other way around.

**Dr. J:** Yeah, staying with presence and communicating from presence.

**Joshua:** This makes me think about Thich Nhat Hanh and his ideology of being present. If everyone was able to put down all the distractions and walk around a room, or go on a walk outside, and not try to think about anything but just purely observe nature... it’s embodying the feeling of observation. Just staring at some random tree. That’s what I’m staring at right now; I see the flies flying over, and I see the reflection in the water. People are too scared of being in a quiet space with their mind. The mind’s reality is scary. To really stop and think about what’s going on in today’s world—that’s scary, right? But you don’t have to... you can just *be*. And if you can be without any worry or without any thoughts at all, and you can just experience and observe... into that space where you’re just kind of completely vulnerable to your eyes and your senses... that’s already a step in the right direction.

**Dr. J:** Radical presence.

**Joshua:** Body presence. Embody presence. See? There we go.

**Dr. J:** "Embodied Presence" could be one of the pillars of your solution. If the solution is "we need to cultivate a culture of presence with life and death," then you could have one of the branches of that practice be "Embodied Presence." Maybe you guys will come up with three main roots about how we create a culture of intimacy with life and death. Maybe Jaya will talk about a different type, and Julian will talk about the historical/economic piece of it. But right now, you’re talking about the personal practice.

**Joshua:** I guess I could just make a slide... cite Thich Nhat Hanh, some of his works, and talk about that embodied presence. But I think the reason I’ve been rebounding off of everything is because I feel limited by the TMP. It’s subconscious. I’m trying to "dumb it down" because I’m under the impression that the "institution" is either not going to like these ideas or they’re not going to take them seriously. And I think that’s my own mind. I think the AP graders are open to these presentations.

**Dr. J:** That’s also an initiation into living in this world. I suggest that you speak your truth and do it well. Otherwise, would you really want to start yourself in a pattern of censoring yourself? Or do you want to practice speaking your full truth and letting the world deal with it?

**Joshua:** Yeah. I think also a key would be making it relatable. Should I talk about like... when’s the last time you’ve gone out and just stared at a random object in your house? Walked around your room? Gone on a walk outside and just felt your senses? Observed what’s around you? The experience of being alone and being vulnerable—and being perfectly fine with it. Relatability would make it understandable.

**Dr. J:** What’s more difficult for people is when you remind them that type of presence is beautiful, but it’s also scary. Vulnerability, life, and death. Why do we constantly scroll? Why do we constantly distract ourselves? Because of that. So, part of creating a culture of intimacy with the energy of life and death is to start practicing that.

**Joshua:** It’s not like we’re creating a new religion. It’s not about what other people think. People are so focused on "Oh, what will other people think of this? Will I get judged?" You need to be vulnerable and be open to getting judged. Be open to just not giving a f\*\*\*.

**Dr. J:** I agree.

**Joshua:** Because it’s not about them. It’s about your process. The experience of being alone with your mind and not being stuck with other people's opinions and thoughts.

**Dr. J:** Agreed. If you choose to live your life according to other people’s judgments, you might be more popular. You might avoid conflict. It’s also inevitable that you will essentially be binding your own spirit and sabotaging your intelligence. That’s a given. So, are you willing to live as self-crippled in order to maybe be more popular and less offensive? That’s the trade.

**Joshua:** That’s the choice. We’ve got to present people with a choice. Yeah, that vulnerability can be scary, but it’s beautiful. Because at the end of the day, death is still inevitable. So it’s not about running away from it or being popular. If you’re just popular and you’re sabotaging your own soul, you’re still going to die. So why not actually learn how to be vulnerable and open to your emotions?

**Dr. J:** Exactly. Which is to say: to live your life as fully as it can be lived.

**Joshua:** We’ve been given these profound thoughts and this mind that’s capable of so many things, but we’re just suppressing it with politics and social media and all this s\*\*\*.

**Dr. J:** Which may be why the system we live in encourages us *not* to think about this. Because if you think about it...

**Joshua:** The people... they lose control.

**Dr. J:** Exactly. Because people who think about it are not willing to live "half-lives."

**Joshua:** No matter the cost. Wow, that’s so true. This is why it’s a radical thought. This is why we are heretics. It’s being capable of not caring—at its core, not giving a f\*\*\*.

**Dr. J:** Essentially. I mean, I might care, but I don’t care as much as I do about sacrificing the opportunity to live my life.

**Joshua:** Exactly. Are you willing to just... I mean, granted, the institutions do control us really well. The mass society—they do a really good job at it. I’m not going to lie.

**Dr. J:** That’s true right now more than ever.

**Joshua:** Exactly. And we need to break that barrier. "This is what’s happening to you. This is what they’re doing to you. It’s your choice if you want to allow that to happen or if you want to really get down to the bones."

**Dr. J:** Down to the marrow.

**Joshua:** Down to the spiral of the human mind.

**Dr. J:** The root of the Tree of Life.

**Joshua:** The Tree of Life, yo\! This is not just some drawing that some guy once made. This is not just a story. No, this is experience. The experience of other human beings. You can talk about that. "Hey, you know what I’ve been doing? I’ve been living the experience of life." You talk to your buddies about that, and they might be like, "What the f\*\*\* are you talking about?" But then it's like, "Wait, hear me out. Have you ever just looked around your room and stared at some random object? Have you ever gone out on a walk without your phone, without any music, without any distractions, and just *been there*?"

**Dr. J:** Yeah. A lot of people come to Ubud to pay a lot of money to get a taste of something like that. "Look another person in the eye for a minute."

**Joshua:** For example\! Have you ever really looked at someone? People avoid eye contact so much everywhere. That’s such a controlled, institutionalized thing to do. Once you’re able to actually look at someone without breaking that silence... that’s a human being. That’s when you realize, "Yo, this is a person."

**Dr. J:** And you realize that it’s a mirror. Just like being in nature—you start to be like, "Whoa, I’m alive. What’s going on here?"

**Joshua:** And that’s scary. But it’s beautiful. If you’re able to make peace with that vulnerability and make peace with being scared.

**Dr. J:** That brings us to death. People don’t usually make that connection, but essentially all of these things bring us into contact with life and death.

**Joshua:** Exactly. And then we make peace with it.

**Dr. J:** It takes a year, two years, three years of being with it.

**Joshua:** Death as a companion?

**Dr. J:** Yeah, exactly. And a partner. I believe in that. My mantra for about two years straight was just about death. It’s partly about motivation. This is related to what I was mentioning earlier about how much of people’s creative energy is actually locked up in hiding from death. So, if you stop hiding from that—if you make it a companion—that unlocks a huge chunk of the human mind.

**Joshua:** This is what I was waiting for. This is what I needed. And then you have another branch of that, which is being open and vulnerable to your emotions. Everyone has suppressed emotions and people are terrified of them. You need to find a space where you can be with those emotions. That will teach emotional intelligence, and that is the key to living a life where you value yourself as a person.

**Dr. J:** Well, even if we take the phrase "emotional intelligence" out of that—giving yourself the space to feel your emotions honestly and straightforwardly is the key to valuing yourself as a person. Because if you don’t give yourself that space, who will?

**Joshua:** It’s the key to self-love.

**Dr. J:** You can’t have self-love if you’re living within a prison of your own mind. It also has to do with this kind of self-honesty and unfilteredness. If I silence myself or shut myself down so that I'll be accepted, will I ever truly feel self-love? Haven’t I then fundamentally betrayed myself? It’s like the child within me is living inside a locked-up room, and I’m the jailer. Maybe I’m apologizing, "I'm sorry it's this way, but the world's tough, so stay in there and shut up."

**Joshua:** I made that realization about two months ago. I’ve been like that little guy inside of me.

**Dr. J:** I would rather that guy inside of me be unpopular, but I stand with him.

**Joshua:** He’s your companion. You can’t just suppress him.

**Dr. J:** I’d rather be unacceptable. I’d rather us be heretics than for me to turn on myself. Better to have true companionship with oneself than with the whole world.

**Joshua:** That is experience. That is life. That is meaning. You see, "meaning" is kind of a hijacked term. When I talk to people about "finding meaning," they think of something material, something external.

**Dr. J:** That’s right.

**Joshua:** Meaning is kind of related to self-love.

**Dr. J:** It is. Meaning is an internal relationship with yourself.

**Joshua:** We were put on this Earth not just to reproduce, but to actually figure out who we were and live in harmony with the self. That’s where true meaning lies.

**Dr. J:** I agree with you. This makes me think of the old term, **Ikhidaya** \[Aramaic\]. Back then, the students of Jesus actually had a specific word for him. They didn’t usually call him Messiah or Savior; they called him *Ikhidaya*. It means "The Undivided One." The one who is not divided within himself. That’s the meaning of a "Holy One"—he’s simply whole. He’s not splitting himself. That’s it.

**Joshua:** Exactly. Jesus, for example—he didn’t want people to necessarily follow his teachings; he wanted people to find that meaning within themselves.

**Dr. J:** I think so. That’s why he teaches in riddles and stories. When they ask, "When will the Kingdom of Heaven be here?" he says, "The Kingdom of Heaven is within you."

**Joshua:** Exactly. 

**Dr. J:** He didn't want to just give people an answer; he wanted people to actually think and figure it out for themselves. Because you can't give the answer with your mind externally—the answer is a living relationship with yourself. It doesn’t matter how much meaning I give you if you’re not living it in your own relationship with yourself. In the end, it’s meaningless. All I can do is be a tuning fork that you have to resonate with in your own being.

**Joshua:** These are some profound realizations. This is making me actually think instead of trying to focus on that freaking presentation.

**Dr. J:** So, that’s the bridge to build: let the presentation be an expression of truth. An expression of your own tuning fork. If you have to shift the language to be appropriate to the media—I do that all the time—but I don’t compromise the fundamental message.

**Joshua:** Yeah, exactly. Citing Buddhist monks and philosophers who are familiar with this will make it more... if I just talk about my personal experience, they might not listen. But there are so many people—historical figures, modern figures—who know this.

**Dr. J:** Many are trying to share this resonance. Sometimes the defense spikes right before the breakthrough.

**Joshua:** That’s a good point. In the moment, I was like, "Why am I getting defensive?" Clearly, there’s something here, and I really want to explore that. I’m going to challenge myself. It’s also about challenging the mind. Step one of challenging the mind in the modern world could be just observing and experiencing what’s around you.

**Dr. J:** Right. That moves the center itself from the busy mind into...

**Joshua:** Exactly.

**Dr. J:** This is what people often misunderstand about me. Everything my mind does is already in service to my soul. My mind is not actually in charge. People are used to anyone with a powerful mind being *ruled* by that mind. Most people don’t have a category for someone who has trained a powerful mind to serve Presence. In the Old World, we had categories for that—monks, Jesuits, Taoists. But we’ve mostly forgotten that path in the West.

**Joshua:** Exactly. We’re pulling it by the root.

**Dr. J:** I like that. 

**Joshua:** Our world is so f\*\*\*ed up today that we can't even really be with ourselves. 

**Dr. J:** And yet, the only way the world heals is when we start.

**Joshua:** It’s crazy how right now there’s like a mind map in my brain connecting this to all the previous stuff I wrote about. It’s a literal mind map, not some external software.

**Dr. J:** If you think about it, it's basically a neural net. Most people don’t develop the internal mind enough, and then they start relying on external tools. The trick is to develop the internal mind to be powerful so that it can use external tools without being consumed by them. To be the conductor.

I had a vision about this eight years ago, before AI. I was inside a mech suit. I realized the mech suit was all technology—books, writing, all the tools of civilization. We can use them, but they also use us. In the vision, I could feel the electricity of the suit trying to enter my skin, like it was possessing me. But I could feel that I had a different type of energy coming from my own core that could push back. I knew in that moment my mission was to develop internal strength—internal energy strong enough to pilot the technology and not be consumed by it. Now, that is literally what I’m doing. I’m in the middle of the mech suit, learning to command the technology.

**Joshua:** So instead of it commanding you, you command it.

**Dr. J:** Yeah. If you can have Presence in it, then you gain incredible power. But very few people can be in it and not be eaten by it.

**Joshua:** Control over the self.

**Dr. J:** The fundamental source of that control is that Presence and vulnerability. That humanity. That’s where the power comes from. It’s facing death and life that gives a person that power. Genius, too. People think genius is some random trait. Genius is the ability to maintain yourself in contact with powerful forces. Geniuses aren't just good at math; they are able to keep their minds intact while big forces pass through them.

**Joshua:** It's not letting external forces take control.

**Dr. J:** Then you're able to be in a relationship, co-creating with the external force. That’s why geniuses don't say "I figured out calculus"; they say "It was revealed to me" or "It’s passing through me." Einstein and Oppenheimer were famous for saying they hated doing calculations. They were more like channels. People don't realize that.
