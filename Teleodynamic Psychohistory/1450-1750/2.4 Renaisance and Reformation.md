# **Chapter 2.4: The Renaissance and the Reformation**

In 1401, the city-state of Florence held a competition to design bronze doors for its baptistery. Seven artists submitted proposals. The winner, Lorenzo Ghiberti, would spend twenty-seven years creating doors so magnificent that Michelangelo would later call them the "Gates of Paradise." The runner-up, Filippo Brunelleschi, went home in fury and taught himself architecture out of spite. He would go on to build the largest dome since ancient Rome.

This was how the Renaissance worked. Not through grand proclamations or royal decrees, but through competitions, rivalries, and the kind of pride that drives men to reshape reality itself. In the narrow streets of Italian cities, something was happening that Europe hadn't seen since the fall of Rome: wealth was concentrating in the hands of people who weren't kings or bishops. Merchant families who'd spent generations moving wool and silk across the Mediterranean now commanded fortunes that made princes look poor. They wanted the world to know it.

## **The Economics of Beauty**

As artists shaped marble and painters mixed pigments, merchants were creating their own revolution: modern banking. The innovation began in the counting houses of Florence. The system was simple: *record every transaction twice*. Each entry must balance. The totals must match. This was **double-entry bookkeeping –** accounting made into a science, the foundation of capitalism.

Letters of credit took this further. A wool merchant in London could write a letter to his banker in Florence, who would pay a silk trader in Constantinople, who would then collect from a spice merchant in Venice. Money moved across Europe without anyone transporting a single gold coin. All you needed was a signed, sealed paper and a network of bankers to maintain the system. This made bandits obsolete – a “highwayman” couldn’t steal gold that merchants didn’t carry anymore.

In 1397, Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici took this further. Instead of simply lending money, he began accepting deposits from wool merchants and paying them interest. Then he reinvested their money at higher rates. He made money breed money. The mathematics were elegant and slightly scandalous, and other bankers accused him of “usury,” which was forbidden by Christian law.  Giovanni simply pointed to his books – every transaction was perfectly recorded, every profit precisely calculated. The Church might control souls, but the Medici were learning to control **capital** itself. These were the first steps to a new world, in which financial power would eventually far outweigh military might.

The Medici and other banking families wielded influence of a kind Europe hadn't seen before. A banker who controlled credit could determine whether a prince's war got funded, whether a merchant's venture proceeded, whether a city's grain was bought at fair prices.

Why Italy? The answer lies in geography and politics. Italy was not a nation but a patchwork of city-states, each jealous of its independence, each desperate to prove its superiority over its neighbors. Florence grew rich on banking as the Medicis turned their ledgers into politics. Venice controlled most of the Mediterranean with its merchant galleys, effectively becoming the postal service and “internet” for all of Europe. Its competitor, Genoa, built faster ships and sought new routes, attempting to outmaneuver Venice. In the meantime, Rome remained the seat of the Papacy, exerting a quieter but far more ancient influence on all of Christendom.

The rivalry between the Italian city-states created its own kind of freedom. Just as open and competitive markets maintain freedom in the modern day, preventing a single corporation from ruling the world, the competition between city-states in Italy enabled individual artisans to express themselves and thrive. This might be contrasted with the serfdom found in other parts of Europe and definitely in Russia – under serfdom, the people living on the land are legally bound to stay there, and thus have no options. When people have options, even if that option is only to leave and find another lord (or corporation), then they have leverage and freedom. 

When people have choices, then excellence matters. The Italian city-states were driven to excellence in order to attract the best of the best; if Florence builds a dome, Milan must build one larger. If Venice commissions paintings, Rome must commission better ones. 

At the same time,  individual artisans and thinkers were driven to excellence in order to attract the best patrons.The merchant princes competed through culture, which meant they competed to attract the greatest writers, painters, sculptors, and so on – because in a world of rough equals, excellence becomes the measure of power.

This is the secret that causes over-centralization to collapse in upon itself. When a centralized power is *too successful* at centralizing, then it removes all alternative options. Without alternatives, there is no competition and no incentive for excellence – neither from the authorities nor from the creators beneath them. The Renaissance rose among the Italian city-states, much as the Greek Classical Age rose among the scattered Greek city-states, not in spite of decentralization, but partly because of it.

In the medieval world, a king built a castle to project power. In the Renaissance, a banker built a palace and filled it with art. The great families of Italy – the Medici in Florence, the Sforza in Milan, the papal families in Rome – used art as a weapon in their prestige rivalry. When you commissioned the greatest artists of your age to transform your chapel or palace into something magnificent, you were making a statement: *My family has arrived. We will be remembered. God favors us, because look what we have built in His name.*

When Pope Julius II forced Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel, the artist nearly refused. He was a sculptor, not a painter – but he was not given a choice. For four years, he worked in agony, his neck cramped, paint dripping in his eyes. 

The result? One of the most magnificent artworks ever created. Michelangelo's muscular, dynamic figures aren’t just illustrations of Bible stories. They are arguments in paint: *humans are magnificent, powerful, and made in God's image – not fallen sinners*. 

No one much remembers Pope Julius II – but everyone knows of Michelangelo’s paintings.

The Church remained, at this time, far richer than even the wealthiest of the Italian banking families – and as such, remained the greatest patron of arts and learning in all of Europe. Yet, this patronage was complex. Even as Church sponsorship was crucial for developing culture, its “Inquisition” was burning “heretics” and ensuring that ideas never strayed too far from the boundaries of its **orthodoxy.**

**A Glimpse:** It is 1497, and you are standing in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence. The air is thick with smoke. In the center of the square, a pyramid of wood rises fifteen feet high, and on every level are things that were beautiful this morning: paintings of naked goddesses, leather-bound books of poetry, mirrors framed in silver, silk gowns embroidered with gold thread, musical instruments inlaid with ivory. Your neighbor's lute is up there. You recognize it by the crack in the soundboard.

Savonarola stands beside the pyre in his black Dominican robes, his face skeletal and fierce. "These are vanities\!" he shouts. "Satan's tools to lead you away from God\!" The crowd around you is chanting. Some are weeping. A woman throws her jewelry into the flames.

You are holding a small painting your father commissioned before he died. It shows your family in a garden, your mother young and smiling. It cost him six months of profits from the wool trade.

Savonarola's men are watching the crowd. Looking for those who hold back.

You step forward. You throw the painting onto the fire. You watch your mother's face blacken and curl.

## **Corruption and Reformation: When Faith Sparked Revolution**

The medieval Church had always struggled with corruption, but a dramatic power struggle at the dawn of the 14th century brought this into stark relief. In 1305, French political pressure forced the papacy to relocate from Rome to Avignon, a city near the border of France (nowadays, within France). For over 70 years, popes ruled from Avignon and became increasingly part of French politics. When Pope Gregory XI finally brought the papacy back to Rome in 1377, the crisis deepened. The French cardinals, unwilling to lose their special influence, elected their own pope to rule from Avignon.

The result was a double-papacy. For nearly forty years, Western Christianity had two heads – each claiming to be the “successor of St. Peter,” each excommunicating the other and their followers. Some regions even recognized a third pope. This **schism** reinforced the **crisis of legitimacy** that was rising.

By 1492, the papacy had become such a prize that a Spanish noble family, the Borgias, could seize it through bribery and dirty politics. Rodrigo Borgia, shameless and corrupt, successfully dominated the **College of Cardinals** and became Pope Alexander VI (r. 1492-1503), turning “God's throne” into an extension of his family’s empire. The sale of **indulgences** – documents promising salvation in exchange for large donations – was only the beginning. Rordigo expanded on such established corruption, and openly used the Church’s wealth and influence to advance his family's interests while brazenly selling Church offices (like **bishoprics**) to the highest bidder.

Rodrigo’s son, Cesare Borgia, proved even more ruthless. First appointed as a cardinal despite his obvious unsuitability, Cesare later traded his red cardinal's hat for a military commander's armor. He conquered papal territories with such calculated brutality that he inspired **Machiavelli's** famous guide for wannabe dictators: **The Prince**. The Borgia papacy encapsulated everything wrong with the Church, proving that its critics had been correct for generations. 

The stage was set for **Reformation**.

**A Glimpse:** It is 1517, and you are a pilgrim in Rome. You have walked from Bavaria. Three months on the road. Your feet are ruined. Your savings are gone. But you are here to buy salvation.

Tetzel's booth is set up outside St. Peter's, which is still being built. You can see the construction scaffolding rising behind him, hear the stone-cutters' chisels ringing. The new basilica will be magnificent. This is where your money is going.

Tetzel is fat and sweating in his Dominican robes. He has a loud voice. "When the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs\!" He makes it sound like music.

You have twenty gulden. Your mother is dead six months. The priest said she's in purgatory, burning, waiting for redemption. Twenty gulden will reduce her torture by ten years.

You hand over the money. Tetzel gives you a piece of paper with Latin words and a seal. It's official – signed by the Pope's authority.

You fold the paper carefully. Your mother will suffer less, now. That's what matters.

## **The Printing Press & Luther's Lightning**

In 1505, a German man was caught in a thunderstorm near Stotternheim. Lightning struck so close he was thrown to the ground. Terrified, he cried out to St. Anne: "Save me and I will become a monk\!" Miraculously, he survived. Two weeks later, against his father’s wishes, he joined an Augustinian monastery. Years later, the same man’s own “inner lightning” would strike the Church itself. His name was **Martin Luther.**

In 1517, in Wittenberg, Germany, the legend says that Luther nailed his “**95 Theses**” to the wooden door of his local parish. The right essay at the right time, it turns out, can shake the world.

---

**A Glimpse:** It is 1517, and you are a printer's apprentice in Wittenberg. Your master has just handed you a document. “Ninety-five theses” It’s in Latin. It’s dense and you can barely understand it. Some theology about indulgences and penances and the Pope's authority. 

"Set the type," your master says. "Two hundred copies."

Even though the arguments are too difficult for you, you think you know what this means. You know the Archbishop has men who watch for heresy. You know that printing something like this could get the shop burned and you all arrested. But your master's face is set. “Set the type,” he says again.

You set the type. Letter by letter. By midday your fingers are black with ink and your back aches from bending over the composing stick – but by evening, the first sheet is rolling off the press. By midnight, a hundred copies are drying on the racks in the back room.

Early the next morning, your master bundles them in cloth and sends a bundle off to Erfurt. Then another to Leipzig. Then another to Nuremberg.

Within two weeks, the “Theses” are everywhere. You hear that the Archbishop is indeed furious. You hear that people are reading the pamphlet in taverns, in markets, in churches.

You just set the type. Whatever happens next is not your fault.

During the Renaissance, new philosophies of education were transforming not just what people learned, but how they learned. Medieval education had focused on training clergy and lawyers through memorization – but the new humanist educators had a different goal: creating engaged humans capable of participating in civic life and shaping the world around them.

In schools across Italy, a new vision of education was emerging. The goal wasn't just to transmit knowledge, but to develop whole human beings. Physical exercise joined classical studies. Art and music became as important as grammar and rhetoric. Students learned Greek and Latin not just to read ancient books, but to write and speak with the eloquence needed for public life.

In Mantua, Vittorino da Feltre created his famous "Pleasant House" school, where princes studied alongside talented commoners. His revolutionary curriculum combined physical training with classical learning, art with mathematics, moral philosophy with practical skills. The school became a model for humanist education across Europe, proving that learning could be both rigorous and joyful. Federigo da Montefeltro arrived at Vittorino's school as a spare heir from a minor noble family, with a battle wound that had left him blind in one eye. Under Vittorino's tutelage, he studied classical texts, mathematics, and architecture. He would later become the Duke of Urbino and build a library that rivaled the Vatican's. His transformation showed how humanist education could remake human lives.

The printing press revolutionized learning even further. Before Gutenberg, a university might own a few dozen books chained to library desks. Johannes Gutenberg's movable-type printing press, based on designs from Song China but adapted for Latin and European languages, radically changed all that. By 1500, Venice alone had more than 400 presses producing thousands of books. Students could now own their own texts, make notes in margins, and compare different editions. Knowledge was no longer something locked away in monasteries – it had become portable, personal, and increasingly affordable.

In this new world of print, textbooks emerged as a powerful force for standardizing and spreading knowledge. The printer Aldus Manutius created portable editions of classical texts that students could actually afford. His small, octavo-sized books became the Renaissance equivalent of paperbacks, spreading humanist learning beyond university enclaves.

When Erasmus visited Venice's Aldine Press in 1507, he found something extraordinary: scholars working as proofreaders, debating fine points of classical texts as the presses rolled. The printing house had become a new kind of university, where knowledge wasn't just preserved – it was actively created and corrected through collaborative scholarship. Erasmus himself would stay to edit texts, sleeping on a cot between the printing presses, like many of his fellow influencers in this newborn cultural medium.

---

**A Glimpse:** It is 1507, and you are a student in Venice. You have walked three hours to reach the Aldine Press because you heard that Erasmus himself is here, editing manuscripts.

The workshop smells of ink and damp paper. The press in the corner is rolling, and the sound is like thunder contained in wood. A man with ink-stained fingers hands you a small book, freshly bound. It fits in your palm. The pages are crisp, the letters sharp and clean.

"Virgil's Aeneid," he says. "Eight soldi."

Eight soldi. A week's meals. But this is Virgil. In your hand. Not chained to a university library desk, but yours to carry home, to read by your own candle, to mark with your own notes.

You count out the coins.

In the back room, you can see Erasmus bent over a manuscript, a pen in his hand, arguing with the printer about a Latin verb. They are making books the way your father makes clothes. Line by line. Thread by thread. Page by page.

You could not have imagined that the future would arrive so soon.

*Deep Theme: The Democratization of Knowledge*

When Gutenberg's printing press arrived in the 1450s, the Catholic Church initially celebrated it. Here was a tool that could spread the word of God more efficiently than an army of monks copying by candlelight. Pope Pius II called it "a divine gift." Within decades, the Church realized its mistake.

The printing press didn't just make books cheaper. It made ideas impossible to control. Before print, if the Church wanted to suppress a dangerous book, it could burn a few dozen copies across Europe and it was gone. After the press, a book could be reproduced in thousands of copies across a dozen cities before the authorities even knew it existed. When Luther's “95 Theses” were nailed to a church door in 1517, they were reprinted and distributed across Germany within two weeks. The Church tried to burn every copy. They might as well have tried to unring a bell.

The printing press marks a line in human history. Before print, the medieval world was held together by controlled information. The Bible was only in Latin, and the peasants couldn't read. Literacy was locked away in monasteries. Knowledge was a carefully guarded privilege. 

The printing press shattered that world. Now, ordinary people could own the same texts studied in universities, and new ideas could spread faster than any army could march to suppress them.

Once knowledge becomes cheap and decentralized, authority must defend itself with arguments rather than just force. When **Authority** must explain itself as reasonable, it becomes vulnerable to **Reason**.

---

The Protestant Reformation wasn't just a religious movement – it was a revolution in how humans related to divine authority. Luther's core ideas struck at the very foundation of medieval Christianity:

*Salvation comes through faith alone, not rituals. Scripture is the only true authority, not Church tradition. Every believer can interpret the Bible personally. The Church's hierarchy has no biblical basis.*

Later, hunted by the Church and its Catholic princes, undercover in his secret hideout at Wartburg Castle, Luther undertook a revolutionary act: he began translating the New Testament into German. His goal wasn't just to make scripture readable – it was to break the Church's monopoly on divine truth. He would use the printing press to allow everyday people to interpret Christ for themselves: to make religion their own. "Every Christian," Luther declared, "is a priest."

When confronted by Church authorities at the Diet of Worms in 1521, Luther refused to back down: *"Here I stand. I can do no other."*

---

## **The German Peasants' War**

The spark of Luther’s Reformation landed in dry and ready tinder. By 1524, the radical ideas – that common people could interpret scripture for themselves – had evolved far beyond theoretical theology. Across German-speaking lands, peasants began to ask dangerous questions: If all Christians were equal before God, why did some starve while nobles feasted? If scripture was the only authority, where did it say that peasants should pay crushing taxes and live practically like slaves?

The result was the largest popular uprising in European history before the French Revolution. Hundreds of thousands of peasants took up arms across the German States, not just to protest the Catholic Church, but to fight to equalize the entire social order. Their demands, laid out in their "Twelve Articles," mixed religious righteousness with social justice: the right to choose their own pastors, to end serfdom, to access fishing and hunting grounds, and to limit taxes and labor obligations.

### ***Zoom In: The Weight of the Sword***

*Mühlhausen Forest, June 1525*

Hans Bauer crouches in a hollow beneath an oak tree, his Zweihänder lying beside him in the leaves. The sword is wrapped in oiled cloth now, hidden, but he can still feel its weight even when he's not touching it. Six feet of steel. Weighs as much as a small child. He carried it for eight years across Italy and Germany, and now he doesn't know what to do with it.

His hands shake. Not from fear. From exhaustion. It's been three weeks since Frankenhausen, and he hasn't slept more than an hour at a time. Every time he closes his eyes he sees the hill. The wagons burning. The peasants running. The blood.

He hears voices approaching through the trees. He reaches for the sword automatically, then stops himself. These are the voices he's waiting for. Two men and a woman, moving carefully, checking behind them. They've learned to be cautious. The princes' soldiers are still hunting survivors, still finding rebels hiding in cellars and barns.

The woman sees him first. She's maybe thirty, thin, with a face that's aged beyond its years. Her name is Margarethe. Her husband died on the hill.

"You came," she says.

"I said I would."

The two men settle beside him. One is called Peter, a former baker who can barely hold a pike. The other is Jakob, who might have been a journeyman once, before the rebellion, before everything fell apart. They look at Hans with a mixture of hope and wariness. They know what he was. They've heard the stories.

"There's a man in the village," Margarethe says quietly. "Calls himself Brother Martin. He's preaching about the baptism. The true baptism, not the water they pour on babies. He says we must be baptized in faith and confession."

Hans knows about this. There are preachers scattered through Thuringia and Franconia now, men who survived Frankenhausen or who came after, speaking in barns and forest clearings about a new way. No lords. No oaths. No swords. Some of them knew Müntzer. Some of them are trying to make sense of what happened on that hill.

"What does he say about the sword?" Hans asks.

"That a Christian cannot wield it. That Christ's kingdom is not of this world. That we must be defenseless as sheep among wolves."

Hans looks down at his Zweihänder. The cloth has come loose at one end and he can see the pommel, shaped like a wheel. The grip is wrapped in leather, darkened by years of sweat. He's killed men with this sword. Swiss men at Bicocca. Other landsknecht men in tavern brawls over dice. Various men whose faces he can't even remember.

And peasants, probably, at Frankenhausen, in the chaos. Who knows who fell to whom?

---

*Bicocca, April 1522*

Hans stands on the earthen rampart behind the sunken road, his Zweihänder held ready. The morning sun is bright, almost cheerful. In the distance, across the open field, he can see them coming. Two massive columns of Swiss pikemen, maybe 4,000 men in each block. Their drums beat the march rhythm: boom, boom, boom. The sound carries across the field like a heartbeat.

He's fought the Swiss before. Everyone has. They're the best infantry in Europe, or they were until the Germans learned to copy them. The rivalry between Swiss and Landsknecht is vicious. *Kuhschweizer*, Hans and his comrades call them. Cow-fuckers. The Swiss call the Germans Swabian filth. When they meet, it's *Schlechtekrieg* – Bad War. No quarter given or asked.

Today Hans is standing with the Imperial army under Georg von Frundsberg. The great Landsknecht captain, the father of the pike squares. Hans is a Doppelsöldner now, a double-pay man, which means he stands in the front ranks and gets eight guilders a month instead of four. Hans is proud. To be a Doppelsöldner means you're not just a common pike-holder. You're a professional. You're the best.

Beside him on the rampart stand four ranks of Spanish arquebusiers. Their matchcords are lit, the slow match smoldering, giving off a smell like rope and sulfur. The Marquis of Pescara walks behind them, checking their formations, his voice calm.

"Let them come close," he says in Spanish, which Hans doesn't understand, but the tone is clear. "Wait for my command."

The Swiss columns reach the sunken road. Hans can see their faces now. Young men, old men, bearded and clean-shaven, all wearing the cross of the Confederacy. Their pikes are held vertical, a forest of ash wood. They're expecting to cross the road and charge the rampart. They've done it a hundred times before. Swiss ferocity has carried the day for fifty years.

But they didn't know about the sunken road. It's deeper than it looks from a distance – eight feet, maybe ten, with steep sides. The first ranks hit it and stop, confused. The ranks behind push forward. The column compresses, men stumbling, trying to find a way across.

And that's when Pescara gives the order.

The arquebuses fire by rank. Four hundred guns, maybe more. The sound is like the world ending. Hans has heard artillery before, but this is different. This is sustained. The first rank fires, then steps back to reload. The second rank steps forward and fires. Then the third. Then the fourth. Then the first rank is ready again.

The Swiss trapped in the sunken road are being shot like animals in a pen. Only a few make it to the rampart. Hans and the other Landsknechts step forward then. 

It's butcher's work. The Swiss are exhausted, disorganized, their pikes too long to be useful at close quarters. Hans uses his Zweihänder in figure-eight sweeps, the way he was taught by the fencing masters. The blade is heavy enough to knock aside a pike shaft or cut through an arm.

That night, in the camp, Hans and his fellow Landsknechts gamble. They play Glückshaus, rolling dice on a board marked with numbers. The number seven is the Wedding. Twelve is the King – take the whole pot. Two is the Pig – pay a penalty. Hans wins three times, loses twice, and gets drunk on wine looted from a nearby villa.

But he can't stop seeing the sunken road. The bodies piled on bodies. The way the arquebuses fired in rhythm, like a machine. 

That night, he sleeps poorly. He tells himself he just drank too much wine.

---

In the forest outside Mühlhausen, three weeks after Frankenhausen, Hans blinks and comes back to himself. Margarethe is watching him.

"You went away," she says.

"Sorry."

"The preacher," Jakob says. "Will you come hear him?"

Hans doesn't answer immediately. He's thinking about something else. A memory between Bicocca and Frankenhausen. The moment when everything started to turn.

---

*A tavern in Nuremberg, winter of 1524*

Hans is between contracts, living on his saved pay, which is running out. The taverns are full of unemployed Landsknechts. Too many soldiers, not enough wars. Men are growing restless, drinking and gambling and fighting and waiting for the next conflict.

A printer's apprentice comes into the tavern selling pamphlets. It is an essay by Martin Luther. Hans can read – not well, but enough. His mother taught him before she died. The pamphlet costs a penny.

It is about Christian freedom. *Freiheit eines Christenmenschen.* Hans reads it that night by candlelight, slowly, sounding out the German words. Luther writes that a Christian is free from all things and subject to no one. That faith alone justifies a man before God. That the Pope and the bishops and all their elaborate rituals are worth nothing. That the Bible is the only authority.

Hans has never thought much about theology. He knows the Our Father and the Ave Maria. He crosses himself before battle. He confesses his sins when a priest was available, though he often forgets to do penance. Religion is really something for clerks and monks. For soldiers like him, what matters is the oath to the flag and the money at the end of the month.

But something moves in Hans as he reads Luther’s pamphlet. If faith alone justifies a man, then all the money paid for indulgences was wasted. All the gold the Church took from soldiers and peasants – what was it for? If scripture is the only authority, then what gave the Emperor the right to make Landsknechts swear oaths they cannot break?

In the taverns, other Landsknechts are asking similar questions. Peasants soon start to ask them too. Hans hears stories about villages refusing to pay tithes, about priests being driven out, about lords panicking because their serfs begin to claim that Christian freedom means freedom from serfdom.

By 1525, Thuringia is in open revolt. A man named Thomas Müntzer is preaching about the eternal league of God, about divine law above all earthly law. Florian Geyer, a Franconian knight, is organizing “the Black Company” – soldiers and peasants fighting together, rejecting the title of "master" and calling each other "brother."

Hans thinks: This is what Luther meant. Liberty. Brotherhood. No more fighting for princes who pay in debased coins and then abandon you when the contract ends – if you are still alive.

Hans joins the Black Company in March. They give him soot and oil to blacken his armor. He learns a new song with them: *Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen*. We are Geyer's Black Company. We refuse to be servants. We target the Pfaffen and the Edelmann – the priests and the princes.

For two months, Hans thinks they might win. He trains peasants in the use of the pike. He helps organize the Wagenburg, the wagon fort, like the Hussite rebels used a century before. He thinks: We have the numbers. We have the righteousness. We have God’s blessing.

Then comes Frankenhausen.

Hans closes his eyes. This memory is harder.

---

*May 15, 1525\. A hill above Frankenhausen Town*

Hans stands with the Black Company near the center of the defensive ring. Around him are 8,000 peasants, many armed with nothing but farm tools. They've chained the wagons together and placed what few pieces of artillery they have in the gaps. It's a strong position, Hans tells himself. It will hold.

Then he can see the princes' army forming up in the valley below. Professional Landsknechts with cavalry. And artillery. Heavy artillery, not the light swivel guns the peasants have. He sees the artillery gunners adjusting their elevation, measuring the distance to the hill.

He knows what's coming. He's seen artillery reduce fortifications, and a wagon fort is not a stone castle. Wood splinters like matchsticks. The splinters pierce whoever is nearby.

Their lead, Thomas Müntzer, notes none of this. He is busy in the center of the ring, preaching. A rainbow has appeared in the sky – a halo around the sun, a parhelion, the kind of atmospheric phenomenon that happens sometimes in spring. Müntzer points at it and shouts: "This is the sign of the covenant\! God is with us\! I will catch their cannonballs in my cloak\!"

The peasants cheer. They believe him. Hans wants to believe it too, but he hears the drums from the valley. It is the distinctive rhythm of the Landsknecht. Boom, boom, boom. He knows that rhythm. It was his rhythm once.

The first artillery ball hits a wagon twenty feet from Hans. The wood explodes. A man beside Hans goes down, his face opened from eye to jaw.

The second ball hits the center of the ring. Men scatter. The third ball hits the left side. The wagons are meaningless. They're just targets.

The peasants start to panic. Hans can feel it spreading like fire in dry grass. Men who've never been under artillery don't know how to handle it. They break formation. They run.

The Landsknechts charge. Hans sees them coming up the hill, pikes leveled. His former brothers in their colorful slashed clothes and broad hats. Men who've sworn the same oaths he swore.

He raises his Zweihänder. He steps forward to meet them. But the peasants are running now, and the Black Company can't hold alone, and the princes' cavalry is circling around to cut off the escape routes.

Hans kills two men – or maybe they're boys, it's hard to tell in the chaos. One has a beard. One doesn't. They die the same way everyone dies when a Zweihänder comes down.

And then Hans sees the blood running down the hill. Literally running, like a stream. The ground is so soaked that water and blood are mixing, flowing downhill toward the town. The smell is overwhelming.

Hans realizes they've lost. More than that, they're being slaughtered. This isn't a battle. It’s a massacre.

He drops to the ground and lies still. He lets the bodies fall on top of him. It's a trick he learned in Italy – play dead until the killing is done, then slip away in the night. It's cowardly. Oh well.

He lies there for hours. Feels men's boots step over him. He hears the screaming in the town as the soldiers hunt down the peasants in the streets. He feels the blood drying in his hair and clothes.

When darkness falls, he crawls out from under the corpses and he runs.

---

Hans opens his eyes. Margarethe and Peter and Jakob are still waiting for him to answer.

"What does this preacher say about oaths?" Hans asks.

"That a Christian cannot swear them," Margarethe says. "That all oaths are forbidden. That we must speak only yes or no."

Hans thinks about the Fahneneid, the oath to the flag that he swore when he became a Landsknecht. He raised three fingers – for the Trinity – and swore loyalty to the Emperor, the Colonel, and the Banner. He swore to stand firm, to not flee, and to defend his comrades to the death.

He broke his oaths at Frankenhausen. All of them, and more.

"I'll come hear him your preacher," Hans says.

"And your sword?" Jakob asks, looking at the Zweihänder.

Hans picks up the weapon. Even wrapped in cloth, it's familiar in his hands – a companion.

At Bicocca, he watched the Swiss die. At Frankenhausen, he watched the peasants die. His sword didn't save anyone. Neither did his faith in Müntzer's rainbow or his trust in God's protection.

"I'll bury it," he says.

They walk deeper into the forest, to a place where the ground is soft. Hans digs a hole with his hands and a stick. He unwraps the Zweihänder and looks at it one more time. The blade is nicked in many places from where it has struck armor and bone. The wheel pommel is scratched. But it remains a beautiful weapon – a masterwork of the blacksmith's craft.

He lays it in the hole and covers it with earth and leaves.

"It is finished," Margarethe says quietly. She speaks like someone quoting scripture, though Hans doesn't know what verse.

They walk to the village. The preacher is already speaking, by candlelight in a barn, surrounded by a dozen people. He might be forty, thin, with the burned out look of someone who's been through fire. His name is Martin – but not that Martin, not Luther. A different Martin, some lesser-known one.

He's reading from a Gospel. *Matthew*, Hans thinks, though he's not sure. The words are in German, not Latin.

"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God."

Outside the barn, the night is growing very dark. The candles flicker. The small community of survivors – rebels, soldiers, peasants – sit together quietly and listen to the Gospel in German. There are no priests. No elaborate ritual. Just people trying to make sense of the catastrophe of their lives to find a way forward that doesn't end in more corpses.

Hans sits among them. His hands are empty. His sword is buried.

But he's breathing. Still here. Still, somehow, alive.

That has to be grace enough.

The shattering of the Church had an unintended side effect. For a thousand years, the Pope was the ultimate authority in Europe, checking the power of kings. The Reformation broke the Pope’s monopoly on religious power – which is exactly why many kings chose to embrace it. The old balance of power was overthrown by the rising Protestants – but **state** **absolutism** rushed in to fill the void.

In England, for example, Henry VIII didn't just change the theology; he made himself the head of a new church and seized the vast lands and riches of the Catholic establishment for himself. In France, the chaos of religious wars led to a desire for a single, strong hand to keep the peace – leading to the rise of “The Sun King” and his descendents – absolute monarchs who claimed they answered to no one but God. The wars that began over which Bible to read ended with the **Treaty of Westphalia (1648),** which established a new rule: *the king of the land decides the religion of the land.* This wasn’t yet **secularism**, but the era of the Universal Church was over. The era of the **nation-state** had begun.

The peasants’ rebellion forced Luther to make a fateful choice. The peasants were using his own words about Christian freedom to justify their revolt. But when they began attacking monasteries and castles, Luther sided with the new Protestant princes against the popular uprising. In his harsh pamphlet "Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants," he called for the rebels to be executed like mad dogs. The same Luther who had defied the Pope now provided the Protestant princes with theological justification for massacring their own people.

At Frankenhausen, Müntzer's peasant army was slaughtered by professional soldiers. Müntzer himself was captured, tortured, and beheaded. During his torture, he was asked if he still believed God was on his side. He reportedly laughed and said, "Everything I've suffered has been for the Gospel's sake." His last letter to his followers urged them never to let the nobles "make you forget that God helps only the powerless." Across Germany, the nobility took a terrible revenge, killing perhaps 100,000 peasants. Some estimates go as high as 300,000. 

Those who survived were pressed back into serfdom, under harsher conditions than before.

**Deep Theme: When Revolution Turns on Its Leaders**

Luther began his protest against corruption with high ideals. He spoke about freedom, about every Christian having direct access to God's truth without intermediaries.

The peasants heard "freedom" and thought: freedom from crushing taxes. They heard "direct access to God" and thought: no more priests telling us we must obey our lords. They heard "scripture is the only authority" and thought: where in scripture does it say we must be serfs? Luther insisted they misunderstood him. He meant spiritual freedom, not social freedom. But once you tell people they can interpret scripture for themselves, you've lost control of what they conclude.

Luther's ideas didn't stop where he intended. Elite intellectuals and reformers often have very specific grievances. They want to fix one corrupt system, to replace a bad king, to reform some specific law. But when their ideas spread to people with less to lose, with more immediate suffering, the same words take on new meaning. "Reform" becomes "overthrow." "Freedom" becomes "revolution."

Such reformers face a choice: to stand with the people who quote their ideas in the face of power, or to side with the existing authorities to restore order. Luther chose the authorities. It would be hard to argue he does not then bear some responsibility for the hundreds of thousands who died as a result.

## **The Catholic Counter-Reformation**

As Protestant ideas spread north, the Catholic Church launched its own revolution – not of rebellion, but of renewal and reform. At the Council of Trent (1545-1563), the leaders of the Church sought to re-invent their tradition from within, to better combat the rising Protestant pressure.

Here, again, one finds the power of **the open market**. The **Catholic monopoly** on European religion was broken. As a result, Catholicism itself was forced to adapt to a new age.

Within the **Council of Trent**, Church leaders debated every aspect of faith and practice, seeking ways to maintain their doctrine while addressing the corruption that fueled Protestant criticism. New, better seminaries were created (drawing on the principles of **humanistic education**\!) to ensure that priests would be deeply educated rather than merely wealthy or obedient. Bishops were required to actually serve in their dioceses rather than just collecting tithes from afar. The sale of Church offices was banned and strict rules governed indulgences.

At the forefront of this new vision of Catholic reformation was the **Society of Jesus – the Jesuits**. Founded by Ignatius of Loyola, a former soldier, the Jesuits combined military discipline with rigorous intellect and deep faith. When Ignatius founded the Jesuits, he drew on his own military background to design his **Spiritual Exercises** – a training protocol for the soul. Jesuits underwent years of rigorous learning in theology, classical languages, and rhetoric. 

The result was an order of missionaries, scholars, and schoolmasters who spread around the world carrying knowledge, service, and even a willingness to die for their mission. They were not simply priests; they were intellectuals and humanists. In fact, Jesuit education was so high-quality that they became the educational leaders throughout Europe, while simultaneously their missionaries carried Catholicism abroad from China to the Americas. 

Jesuits advisors would end up in influential positions in realms as far-flung as Qing China. By 1600, a Protestant observer would grudgingly admit, "A single Jesuit has caused more damage to our cause than an army of ordinary priests." Catholicism, in other words, had learned to compete.

As a result of this Catholic Counter-Reformation, the Papacy didn't die. Instead, the Christian world split in two. Protestants and Catholics fought to convert cities and states worldwide. The conflict unfolded across battlefields from diplomacy and philosophy to their attitudes toward art itself.

While Protestants stripped their churches bare, Catholics doubled down on visual splendor. The Council of Trent declared that art should teach Catholic doctrine and inspire devotion. The result was the birth of “Baroque” art and architecture: a child of the Renaissance – not clean and pure but dynamic, muscular, emotional, and overwhelming in its impact. Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted decades earlier, had already shown the power of this approach. This became the visual language of the Counter-Reformation: manifest proof that Catholic art could move souls in ways that Protestant sermons about purity never could. 

Some of the grandest Catholic churches ever built were part of this battle for souls, including the famed St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Such marvels of the Counter-Reformation were theaters of faith, where architecture, painting, and sculpture combined to create overwhelmingly rapturous experiences to lift the wondering soul toward heaven, for the Glory of God and the Church.

The Protestants, for their part, saw such massive projects as a continuation of Rome's vanity and corruption. Furthermore, such religious arts were considered to violate God's commandment against idols. The idea was that such works of men are a distraction from God’s gift, and that it is fundamentally unchristian to worship images of saints or angels, because worship belongs only to God.

The Catholic Churches thus looked to Protestants a lot like paganism. Ironically, this fact would actually help Catholicism to spread in places like Central and South America, where the local people found it easy to create fusions of Catholic and Native traditions. The resulting systems, like the Cult of Saints in Latin America, were **syncretic blends** of **indigenous mysticism** and Catholic theology. An example is the **Virgin of Guadalupe** – a fusion of the Catholic Mother Mary and an old indigenous goddess of the land. This figure first appeared in New Spain's capital of Mexico City, but she would go on to become widely worshipped through many of the Spanish colonies.

To the Protestants, such practices looked superstitious and even like a kind of black magic. Indeed, some Protestants declared war against Catholic art and icons – a crusade against perceived idolatry called **iconoclasm**. The iconoclasts believed that the Catholics themselves were practicing “witchery,” using art and music (the flowering of the Italian Renaissance) to enchant the people with sorcery.

**A Glimpse:** It is 1562, and you are a novice nun in a convent in Avila, Spain. The stone floor bites into your knees. You are hungry from the fast. At the front of the chapel, Mother Teresa is praying. Suddenly, she stops. She gasps – a sound like someone drowning. 

You look up. Her head is thrown back, her body rigid, her face twisted in an expression that looks like pain but feels like something else. Heat radiates from her. The other sisters are terrified, but you cannot look away. The Protestants have their books and their arguments. But this? This is holy fire.

**Deep Theme: The Competition of Ideas**

In the medieval world, religious authority was a monopoly. The Catholic Church controlled access to scripture, defined what was heresy, and enforced orthodoxy with fire. After the Reformation, that monopoly shattered.

Suddenly Christians had choices. A prince could choose whether his realm would be Catholic or Lutheran or Calvinist. A merchant could move to a city that tolerated his faith. A scholar could publish in Amsterdam what would be banned in Madrid. When religious institutions had to compete for followers, they couldn't rely on authority. They had to persuade. They had to attract.

As a result, both the Catholic Counter-Reformation and Protestant Reformation invested heavily in education, art, and intellectual life. The Jesuits built schools not just to train priests, but to prove that Catholic education could rival any Protestant university. Protestant states translated the Bible into vernacular languages not just for theological reasons, but to demonstrate that they trusted ordinary people with sacred texts. Baroque churches with their overwhelming beauty stood as arguments against Protestant simplicity. Plain Protestant meeting houses stood as arguments against Catholic excess.

The competition drove innovation. The Jesuits became some of Europe's finest scientists and mathematicians. Protestant universities became centers of theology. Both traditions gave birth to philosophers, artists, and thinkers who would shape the Enlightenment to come. In trying to defeat the other, each side made European intellectual life more vibrant than it had been in centuries. 

Ironically, the Catholic Church – the former sponsors of the terrible Inquisitions of the Middle Ages – now became relatively tolerant of variations and local practices, while much of the new Protestant movement became far more dogmatic. This difference was not limited to the “New World” – in Europe itself, some Protestant branches swung toward extreme **puritanism:** seeking to purify themselves and others toward a greater godliness. **Witch-hunts**, once the domain of the Catholic Inquisition in places like Spain, now spread through the Protestant world. In certain places, entire communities were created strictly according to **the Protestant ideal**.

**A Glimpse:** It is 1555, and you are a refugee watchmaker in Geneva.

It is past midnight. In any other city, you would be asleep. But this is Geneva. The Consistory watches everything. If you are idle, you are sinning. If you are sinning, you are not of **the Elect**. 

The oil in your lamp is low. You are tired, but you look at the gear in your hand. Perfect. Flawless. 

You are not just making a watch. You are proving that you are saved.

---

**The Big Questions:**

Could the Church have prevented the Reformation by reforming sooner, or was the split inevitable once the printing press made information impossible to control?

What makes some ideas so powerful they can split continents and reshape societies? Why did Luther's 95 Theses spread like wildfire while other critiques of the Church faded into obscurity?

When revolutionary ideas spread beyond their creators' intentions, who bears responsibility for the consequences? Why did Luther condemn the Peasants' War? How did he justify this to himself?

How does one balance individual interpretations with shared traditions? Can a society survive if everyone becomes the authority on their own inner truth?

---

By 1600, the transformation was complete. The world that Columbus had been born into – a world of unquestioned Church authority, with Latin as the language of learning and knowledge locked away in monasteries – had vanished. In its place stood something new and unstable: a Europe where religious truth was debated, books were printed in common languages, and merchant families wielded power that once belonged only to kings.

The Renaissance had taught Europeans to look back through time to classical greatness and to imagine that they might recreate it. The Reformation had taught them to question authority and trust in their own interpretation of truth. Together, these movements unleashed energies that would reshape the world. In Northern Europe – in places like Amsterdam – scholars has begun asking dangerous new questions. Not about God anymore, but about God's creation. How does the natural world really work? Can we trust our senses and our natural reason to find truth, or must we rely on authorities?

The answer to such questions would birth modern science, modern politics, and the modern world.

In the space of less than two centuries, Europeans had learned that authority could be challenged, that truth could be debated, and that ordinary people could remake the world. **The Enlightenment** would soon be knocking at the Europeans’ door.

### ***Zoom In: The Mandarin from the West***

*The Forbidden City, 1601\.* 

Matteo Ricci stands in a chamber he has never been permitted to enter before. The floor is paved in stone so precisely fitted that he cannot see the seams. The walls are lacquered red – that particular crimson that only the emperor may use – and the beams above are painted with dragons in gold leaf that catches the light filtering through paper screens. The air smells of sandalwood incense and something else underneath, something green and growing from the gardens beyond the walls.

On the table before him lies the map. Silk, not paper. Four feet wide, three feet tall. The world as Europeans know it, drawn in Chinese style with Chinese characters labeling the continents. Europe is no longer at the center. Neither is China. The world spreads across the silk in careful proportion: Asia, Africa, Europe, and the vast Americas that Spain has claimed.

Six Ming officials around the table are studying it. Their robes are silk brocade – blues and greens with embroidered cranes and clouds. Their hats are black lacquer with jade buttons denoting rank. They do not look at Ricci. They look at the map.

Ricci keeps his hands folded in his sleeves the way he has learned to do. Patient. Waiting. His Chinese robes hang heavy on his shoulders – he has worn them so long now that European doublets feel strange and tight on the rare occasions he tries one on. The fabric of his robes is good silk now, dark blue, cut in the scholar's style. His beard is also trimmed in the Chinese fashion. He wears a scholar's cap.

He looks like the Chinese until you see his eyes.

"The barbarians have learned cartography," one official says. His voice is dry, amused.

Another official leans closer, tracing the meridian lines with one finger. "These calculations match the Imperial Observatory's star charts." He glances up at Ricci. "This is sophisticated work."

Ricci bows slightly. "I am grateful for the compliment. The wisdom of the Middle Kingdom informed much of what I have done here."

This is true and not true. The cartography is European – Portuguese and Spanish sailing charts translated into Chinese conventions. But Ricci has learned when to claim Chinese influence and when to claim European innovation. The balance shifts depending on the audience.

He has been performing this balance for two decades.

The memory rises without warning.

*Macau, 1582*. 

The smell of the harbor: salt water, rotting fish, human waste, spices from the warehouses. Ricci steps off the Portuguese ship onto the dock and the heat hits him like a wall. Italy is hot in summer but this is different – the air itself feels wet, heavy, hard to breathe. His Jesuit robes stick to his skin. The sun glares off the white walls of the Portuguese trading post.

A Portuguese merchant passes him speaking rapid Cantonese to a Chinese dock worker. Ricci understands nothing. The sounds are tones – rising, falling, flat – and his ear cannot separate them into words. It is like trying to understand music having never heard a melody.

He is twenty-nine years old. He has been preparing for this moment since he was sixteen – studying theology, mathematics, astronomy, rhetoric – but standing on the dock he realizes he knows nothing that matters here.

A Chinese man approaches him in scholar's robes. Kind eyes. He speaks Portuguese slowly, carefully. "You are the new priest?"

"Yes. Matteo Ricci."

"I am Brother Wu. I will teach you Cantonese. It will take two years, maybe three. Reading and writing characters will take longer. Are you prepared for this?"

Ricci looks past him at the city rising on the hills. Buildings of stone and wood. Temples with curved roofs. Thousands of people moving through streets he cannot navigate – a world entire and complete and utterly foreign.

"Yes," he says. "I am ready."

He was not ready. But he learned anyway.

---

*The Forbidden City, 1601\.* 

One of the officials points to the Americas. "These lands exist? This is not barbarian fantasy?"

"They exist," Ricci says. "The Spanish have established cities there. The Portuguese have claimed the coast of Brazil."

"And these continents were unknown to the ancients? To your Aristotle?"

"They were unknown until recently. The world is larger than the ancients knew."

The officials exchange glances. This is dangerous territory. If the ancient Greeks did not know everything, perhaps the ancient Chinese did not know everything either. Perhaps the texts of Confucius and Mencius are incomplete. Perhaps the Middle Kingdom is not actually central.

Ricci says none of this. He has learned restraint.

Another memory.

---

*A room in Zhaoqing, 1589\.* 

Seven years in China now. Ricci sits at a low table with a Chinese scholar named Qu Taisu. They are discussing Euclid’s *The Elements of Geometry,* which Ricci has translated into Chinese with Qu's help. The book lies open between them, diagrams of triangles and circles drawn with a straightedge.

"This proof," Qu says, tapping the page. "You say that parallel lines never meet, even extended infinitely. How is this known?"

"Euclid demonstrates it through axioms. We begin with self-evident truths and build toward more complex truths."

"Self-evident to whom?"

Ricci pauses. In all his training at the Collegio Romano, no one questioned the axioms. They were foundations, not subjects for debate.

"To reason," he says finally. "To the clear operation of the mind."

Qu considers this. Then he nods slowly. "This is interesting. You use these “axioms” way we use the foundational texts. But we start from different principles."

"Perhaps," Ricci says carefully, "the principles are not so different. We both seek order, yes? Pattern, harmony…"

Qu's eyes brighten. "Yes. Yes, this is true. The Way of Heaven is in geometric perfection."

At that moment Ricci sees it – the way ahead. Not to argue fruitlessly against Chinese thought but to show how Christian truth and Chinese wisdom always point toward the same ultimate reality. God is the Lord of Heaven – Tianzhu in Chinese, a term that Buddhists use but that Ricci can adapt for Christian purposes.

It might work. It might actually work.

---

*The Forbidden City, 1601\.*

The discussion continues. The officials ask about navigation, about the stars sailors use to cross oceans, about the calculations required to map the earth's curve. Ricci answers carefully, precisely. He has brought instruments – an astrolabe, a quadrant, a mechanical clock that chimes the hours. These sit on a side table, brass and steel gleaming in soft light.

"Your clock," one official says, gesturing. "It measures time without water or sand?"

"Springs and gears," Ricci says. "Wound once, it runs for a day. The mechanism is precise."

"May I examine it?"

Ricci lifts the clock and brings it to the official. The man holds it carefully, turning it in his hands. The other officials lean in to see. For a moment they are like children with a new toy, and Ricci feels a rush of affection for them. This is why he does this work. These moments of shared wonder, shared curiosity, the barriers falling away.

But the barriers are always still there. Even now.

Another memory. This one recent.

---

*A week ago, in quarters near the Forbidden City.*

Ricci kneels before his small shrine – a wooden crucifix he carved himself, a candle, a rosary. He prays in Latin. The words come automatically, worn smooth by repetition.

"Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum..."

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

But even as he prays, he is aware of the Chinese sounds outside his window. Street vendors calling. A temple bell ringing. The Chinese language has soaked into his mind so thoroughly that sometimes he dreams in it. Sometimes he catches himself thinking in Chinese rather than in Latin or in Portuguese.

He prays every day. He says Mass alone, lacking a congregation. He maintains his vows – poverty, chastity, obedience. He is still a Jesuit. Still a soldier of the Society of Jesus.

But what kind of Jesuit is he becoming?

He has worn Chinese robes for sixteen years. He can recite the Confucian classics from memory. He argues Mengzi with Chinese scholars and can hold his own. He eats with chopsticks, kneels in the Chinese way, bows with the precise degree of respect each situation requires. He never speaks directly but circles around meaning, suggests rather than states, lets the listener complete each thought.

These are not just skills he has learned. They have changed the way he thinks.

Is he still Matteo Ricci from Macerata? Or has he become Li Madou, the Confucian scholar?

Can a man be both?

---

*The Forbidden City, 1601\.*

The officials straighten from the table. One of them – the eldest, with white in his beard and the highest-ranked jade button on his cap – turns to address Ricci directly.

"The Son of Heaven will review your work," he says. "Prepare your instruments. You will be summoned."

The words land like stones in still water. The Son of Heaven. The emperor himself. The center of the world, from the Chinese perspective. The man who holds the Mandate of Heaven.

Ricci bows deeply. "This humble person is honored beyond measure."

The officials leave, their silk robes whispering against the stone. The sandalwood incense drifts in the shafts of light from the windows. Ricci is left alone in the chamber with his map and his instruments.

He stands very still, feeling the weight of the moment.

Twenty years. He has been in China for twenty years. He has learned the language, learned the customs, learned to think in ways his teachers at the Collegio Romano could never have imagined. He has translated Euclid into Chinese and written treatises on memory and friendship that the scholars debate. He has converted perhaps three hundred souls to Christianity – not many by European standards, but each one a victory against impossible odds.

And now the Son of Heaven will receive him.

This is why he came to China: to penetrate the Middle Kingdom at its highest level. If he can gain the emperor's favor, if he can establish Christianity within the imperial court, then perhaps – just perhaps – China itself might become Christian. A third of the world's population. The most advanced civilization on earth.

Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam. For the greater glory of God.

The Jesuits in Macau think he has gone too far. They say he wears Chinese clothes and quotes Confucius too easily. They say he has lost sight of the Gospel. But Ricci believes that he has found a path others cannot see. He believes that by honoring Chinese wisdom, he honors God who created all wisdom. He believes that by speaking Chinese truth, he makes a pathway for Christian truth.

Outside the windows, evening is falling over the Forbidden City. The gardens fill with shadows. Somewhere in these walls, the emperor sits, surrounded by eunuchs and concubines and ministers, making decisions that affect millions of lives. Somewhere the machinery of empire is grinding forward – taxes collected, armies commanded, justice administered.

And here is Matteo Ricci, an Italian priest in Chinese scholar's robes, waiting to be summoned and to meet the emperor. Waiting to discover if twenty years of work will have meant anything much.

He thinks of Brother Wu, who taught him his first words of Cantonese. He thinks of Qu Taisu, who helped him translate Euclid. He thinks of the Chinese friends he has made, the scholars who have treated him with respect and curiosity rather than contempt.

He thinks of his mother in Italy, whom he will never see again. He thinks of his father who is probably dead by now – letters take a year to travel from Europe to China, and Ricci has not heard from home.

The sandalwood incense has burned down to ash. The light through the windows is fading. The Forbidden City grows quiet as night approaches.

He rolls up the silk map carefully and gathers his instruments. He walks out into the evening, carrying the map under his arm, hearing the whisper of his Chinese robes, thinking in a language his mother could not understand.

---

Ricci went to China to convert the East, but his writings ended up transforming the West. 

When his descriptions of China reached Europe, they stunned the rising intellectual class. Here was a mighty civilization that functioned perfectly with no Christianity, run by scholar-bureaucrats selected through merit (exams) rather than birthright. 

Enlightenment thinkers would later use China as a weapon against the European nobility and clergy. **Voltaire**, for example, argued that if China could have morality and order without the dominion of the Church, then why couldn't Europe as well? 

The Jesuits meant to export their religion, but they imported the seeds of secular change instead.
