# The Lighting of a Fire

Holistic Rigor and Intellectual Apprenticeship as the Future of Education

Education that Inspires  
2025

# **Abstract**

This paper reports the results of action research by Dr. Julian D. Michels on the ETI method as applied to AP student research and performance tasks. The sample includes the complete cohort of full-time students enrolled in ETI’s AP Capstone Diploma experimental microschool, ages 14 to 18. Nationalities included the USA, Sweden, Australia, and the Netherlands: a fully international demographic with English as a second language for 50% of the student body. Prior to ETI methods, student reading, writing, thinking, and motivation levels represented a typically wide range for their age groups. Four of the six students have experienced ETI methods for at least one year, while two (Kian and Aiden) began less than three months ago. The included student samples are not official AP submissions but internal practice rounds not associated with the US College Board. This action research demonstrates the extraordinary development possible even within a short time frame when student-centered and liberatory education is combined with holistic, humanistic mentorship outside of institutional assumptions regarding standardization of teaching and learning.

# **Prologue**

The following research was conducted by the adolescent students of Education that Inspires (ETI) in the autumn of 2025\. ETI is an AP-accredited experimental microschool defined by the motto of *holistic rigor* – the simple but transformative truth that intellectual excellence does not stand opposite student-centered and creative education, but rather is its lifelong partner.

Each of the following teenage students selected their own topics of passion and learned the art of research-as-intellectual-activism through a form of engaged apprenticeship with Dr. Julian D. Michels, mentor and school founder. What results is evidence of what education can become when pursued as human potential cultivated by the human spirit. Whatever else occurs, it is the lighting of a fire: not the filling of a pail.

# It Depends How You Use It: The Benefits and Harms of Influencer Culture Depending on Content, Quality, and Context

Aiden K. Allen (16 years)

## **Introduction** 

Social media influencer culture significantly affects adolescents' health both mentally and physically. This research explores how influencer culture affects Western adolescents aged 15–19 — a group highly active, online,  and influenced by digital trends.

In recent years, influencers have become powerful figures across media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, shaping trends, opinions, and self-perception. This form of influence can lead to dangerous psychological and emotional effects, such as parasocial relationships, anxiety, idealized imagery, body dissatisfaction, and depression. However, it may also come to positive aspects, including: social support, humour, inspiration, identity development, and much more. Its effects depend largely on the influencer themselves. Some find influencer culture to be neither categorically good nor bad. Instead, their argument centers on how the youths respond differently depending on content, quality, and context. 

In summary, adolescents are in a stage of development and vulnerability. This process of growing means they are highly influenced by others. Because of this vulnerability, influencers — whose role expanded due to the constant use of social media – have the capability of shaping youths’ opinions and thoughts. Many argue that exposure to social media is inherently dangerous, whilst others view it as both harmful and beneficial. Because the media is so enormous, there are multitudes of content — some that connect with personal struggles, and others that may worsen them.

## **The Balance and Context**

Several recent studies agree that influencer impacts are not simply "good” or "bad” but rather multifaceted. Adeane and Stasiak (2024) found that teens (ages 14-19) strongly value influencers who seem to be authentic and relatable. Adolescents prefer those who share real and personal experiences, over the polished commercialized content. For example, some influencers genuinely promote mental health awareness. On the other hand, others mix those posts with product promotions, which can feel fake or exploitative (Croates et al. 2019). These factors greatly affect how teens interpret influencer content. Adeane & Stasiak found no single “right” way for influencers to discuss mental health – each style has positives and negatives depending on tone, content, and honesty.

Adeane and Stasiak concluded that influencer messages can be both helpful and harmful, depending on how they are presented and received. Valkenburg and colleagues (2022) support this view through an umbrella review, in which they analyzed 33 reviews and meta-analyses on social media and adolescent mental health. They found that the overall results were weak, inconsistent, or mixed, meaning that social media’s effects are not universally harmful or beneficial but depend on who uses it, how it’s used, and what type of content is being consumed. 

This reinforces the idea that the effects of influencer culture are context-dependent – much like social media in general. Uhls et al. (2017) expand on this by explaining that social media has become deeply intertwined with adolescent development, shaping identity, relationships, and emotional growth. Together, these studies form a balanced perspective. They show that the influencer culture's impact depends on tone, intent and the development stage of its audience. 

## **The Harm and Vulnerability** 

While Adeane and Stasiak, Valkenburg et al., and Uhls et al. focus on the balanced aspects of influencer culture, other studies take a more critical approach, examining the harm and vulnerability that accompany it. Nesi and Prinstein (2015) found that adolescents – particularly young teenage girls – who are exposed to idealized content often engage in habitual social comparison and online feedback-seeking, which tends to correlate with higher depressive symptoms. 

Sherlock and Wagstaff (2018) find a similar effect: Simply viewing idealized instagram images (e.g., beauty/fitness influencers) caused women in their study to feel less attractive and more anxious about their appearance. Resulting in a significant drop of self-rated attractiveness that directly ties into increased anxiety and body dissatisfaction. Unlike Adeane and Stasiak, Sherlock and Wagstaff argue that influencer harms stem directly from idealized, unrealistic imagery – intentionally shaping audiences through perfection-based content.

Radovic and colleagues (2017) elucidates the potential risks of influencer culture by interviewing 23 depressed adolescents in order to understand how they use social media. The teens reported both positives (seeking humour, inspiration, or supportive peers) and negatives (sharing risky behavior, being cyberbullied, or making harmful self-comparison). Radovic et al. identified three problematic behaviors: oversharing, stress posting, and trigger posting. Importantly the study shows that over time, their habitual use of social media shifted from more negative to positive engagements. Altogether, this backs up the claim of "mental health risk” ; it shows that the substantial group of adolescents with pre-existing vulnerabilities can be easily harmed by influencers promoting unsafe content. Ultimately, these studies highlight the emotional and psychological harm that influencer culture can inflict upon adolescents, particularly through unrealistic standards and social comparison. 

## **The Identity, Culture, and Systemic Influence**

While emotional harm is a major consequence of influencer culture itself, another important impact lies in how it shapes adolescents’ sense of identity, authenticity, and belonging. Davis (2018) examines how gender and sexuality shape social media use by analyzing popular Instagram users. These pages, with thousands of followers, posted about “college life” but often featured misogynistic and stereotypical content. Most of the posts identified women as objects – only attracted to their looks rather than intelligence or personality. Davis implies that even fun, normal, engaging social media posts can spread harmful gender stereotypes. This aligns with Abidin's (2021) idea "microcelebrity,” where influencers show only a certain type of beauty or gender role. This can be a starting point to where teens begin to believe there are only certain ways of being desirable or even loved.

Social media can also be a place where adolescents shape their identity and connect with peers. Danah Boyd (2014/2020) explores how teenagers use these online spaces to express themselves, experiment with identity, and seek belonging. Her work expands upon Adeane & Stasiak and Sherlock & Wagstaff by showing that teens don't just use social media for fun, but to find meaning and express who they are. This helps explain why influencer culture is so powerful: influencers don’t just entertain, they construct what identity, authenticity, and belonging looks like for their viewers. Together, these studies show that influencer culture extends far beyond mental health, it goes into how young people define who they are and how they connect with others.

## **The Conclusion**

Influencer culture plays a powerful role in shaping adolescents' ability to think, express, and connect in today's digital world. Influencer culture is complex, producing both positive and harmful effects. Adeane, Valkenburg, and Uhls find influencer culture to be context-dependent. Not merely "good” nor "bad”. Its effects depend on who the teen is, what content they engage with, and how they use it. Nesi, Sherlock, and Radovic challenge this view by claiming that influencer exposure exacerbates adolescents' mental health– specifically those with pre-existing vulnerabilities.  

Davis, and Abidin reflect on something outside of mental health: Identity and belonging. They note that influencer's ability when shaping trends and content reveal to be harmful and stereotypical even when they seem friendly and engaging. Boyd– however having the same idea– constructs a different claim. She believes that influencer culture is key for adolescents' development. Influencer culture is a powerful thing when intercepted properly, it helps build meaning, expression, and identity. 

Social media is growing bigger than ever before. Unlike in the 1970s, when people encountered influencers only through newspapers or television, today their presence is instant– you can see, hear, and understand them with a single click. Influencers now shape how adolescents think, feel, and define themselves, setting both inspiring and unrealistic standards. Yet, the power of influencer culture does not have to be destructive. By learning to question, analyze, and interpret what we see online, adolescents can transform influencer culture from something that controls them into something that strengthens them. In the end, the real influence lies not in the influencer, but in how we choose to respond.

# Effects of the Connectivist Model on Homeschooling

Thomas Soares (14 years)

## **Introduction**

In the recent past, the public education system of America has been faced with some concerning issues. Underfunding, understaffing, racism, and classism have given exigence for a better alternative to the system, the most widely known and chosen option being homeschooling – although homeschooling is shown to have numerous benefits for students such as social skills, emotional development, and college preparation (Murphy, 2014), choosing independent learning has historically come with a major challenge: a home environment lacks availability of the resources and social networks that public school is able to offer. A new solution to this dilemma, however, is emerging in the form of Connectivism.

## **Defining Connectivism**

The term connectivism has been used multiple ways in education theory. For the purposes of this paper, we borrow the definition of Marrero-Guillamón (2012); *“Connectivism refers to the knowledge that emerges in a network from the interaction within a group.”* More importantly for this paper, however, Connectivism also denotes a model of such schooling based upon these foundations – one closely connected to educational-technological developments such as MOOCs and online resources (Downes, 2020).

The model analyzed in this paper roughly follows the system given by Kultawanich, Koraneekij, and Songkhla (2014). This model details a learning pipeline for studying a given subject consisting of four steps: aggregation using online networking, remixing using the web and search engines, repurposing via creating new information, and feeding forward said work using social media. This model was chosen as it uses connectivist theory and connectivist technology which has emerged more recently and enables a better homeschooling experience.

## **The Crisis in American Education**

It goes without saying that the American school system is imperfect – however there are multiple serious problems which threaten the education of its students. The first of these issues is inegalitarian funding: According to a non-partisan report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), not only is there major disparity in the academic opportunities offered to students in poorer schools, there’s also a major discrepancy in opportunities provided to ethnic minorities (GAO 2016; 2018). Ultimately, these studies reveal that the public education system favors only a very small percentage of the total population, while the rest are provided with strikingly less.

It’s not only its equality that is flawed though – its ideology is too. Since the late 20th century, the public schooling system has been documented to follow what Stanford professor of education Tyack, D. B. (1974) described as a “factory mindset” – a focus on the pursuit of grades and perceived academic performance over real results in post-school capability and competence. One detrimental result of this phenomena can be seen in the form of cramming: high-stakes testing most often leading to a focus solely on passing and a negligence of topical information not covered on the test (Au, 2007).

## **The Rise of Connectivism**

While there are many fervently debated complications attached to homeschooling, such as the lack of readily available resources and communities, connectivism changes this discourse: now online resources and communities of practice can be found with ease around virtually any subject. In addition to this, MOOCs are equipped to present such educational information while remaining entirely free (Gonçalves & Osório, 2018). Information-rich homeschooling is now feasible, and it offers a powerful alternative to the injustices of the public schooling system.

Furthermore, connectivism-fueled homeschooling is shown to allow a more personalized, result-bearing learning experience. In a peer-reviewed 2018 study conducted by Zulkifley, Nor, and Siti on the effectiveness of the independent connectivist model, it was found that “autonomy, diversity, interactivity, openness and Web 2.0 have a positive significant effect on students’ achievement.” Professors of Technology Sarnok K. and Wannapiroon P. (2018) attest to the previous statement, in addition to connectivist theory’s greater benefits in higher education and independent study.

## **The Dangers of Connectivism**

This approach isn’t without fault though. One of the central challenges that connectivist theory faces is distribution of information; in his paper “The Cybernetic Episteme”, philosopher-cyberneticist Dr. Julian D. Michels (2025a) details this problem, stating that a major risk to information access is posed in the form of digital resource gatekeeping and centralized monocultural search prioritization. The availability of knowledge is in turn a serious issue for connectivism – if varied and true information is not made available, but instead controlled by centralized interests, then it is proposed that the connectivist model could become a medium for technocratic domination of free thought (Michels, J. 2025b).

There are proposed solutions to these concerns, however. Michels (2025a) also argues that these risks could be addressed by way of Web 3.0 technology and a novel post-normal stack respectively: gatekeeping and corporate centralization would become a non-issue thanks to Web 3.0’s individual-level structure, moving control over available information back to users. As for the proposed multi-stack processing system, Michels (2025a) details it as “A paradigm-detection system designed to surface revolutionary advances that legacy filters misread as error”  – a system which would allow new information to penetrate the monocultural barriers of the internet, previously flagged as misinformation and discarded. These technologies could provide the optimal situation for connectivist distance learning; The technology is yet to be implemented though, and its effectiveness is yet to be seen.

## **Conclusion**

For the first time in history, connectivism has rendered information so widely available that resource-rich homeschooling is viable on a large scale; although there are serious challenges with the implementation of connectivist theory such as those demonstrated by Michels (2025a), their solution could potentially garner significant positive results – not only freeing students from the injustices of the public schooling system, but also raising an innovative and academically advanced (Sarnok & Wannapiroon, 2018\) generation of future thinkers.

# Modeling Intellectual Humility: Cultivating Critical Thinking Through Parental Guidance in the Age of AI

Joshua D. Pieters (18 years)

## **Introduction**

Social media plays a significant role among high school adolescents, its popularity having become deeply embedded in teen life over the past decade. With the introduction of social media came serious consequences. Not only are the algorithm-driven platforms substantially lowering the average attention span, they promote an even larger issue today: Misinformation. Fake news, misinformation, and AI generated videos are spreading faster and farther than ever before — and high school teenagers (ages 14–17) are especially susceptible to it. There have been countless studies regarding this problem today, because when over 80% of students mistake ‘sponsored content’ for real news, critical thinking isn’t optional, it’s essential. The answer to the solution isn’t to ban technology, it’s cultivating critical thinking. This paper goes into critical detail on how parents can help their teens build this essential skill by modeling intellectual humility, creating tech-free spaces for conversation, and teaching them to ask questions regarding posts they see online.

## **Evidence**

According to several studies, teens are shown to be highly vulnerable to social media influence. The lack of critical thinking causes them to blindly believe and share information seen on the internet. A prime example of this is a study run by  Stanford University History Education (SHEG) in 2016\. In this study SHEG tested over 7800 students on their civic online reasoning skills. They did this by giving students real online tasks, things one might see on their phone, and asked them to judge credibility. 

For example, during a middle school task, over 80% of students failed to distinguish "sponsored content" from real news, mistaking clear advertisements for actual stories (SHEG, 2016). When asked to evaluate an anonymous photo of "mutant daisies" as evidence of radiation damage near Fukushima, most high schoolers accepted the image as strong proof without questioning the random source or verifying the claim. Likewise, college students evaluating a poll cited in a tweet rarely clicked the link to check the source, accepting the data only because it sounded true, not because they verified it.

The challenge is only growing more urgent with the rise of AI-generated media. A 2024 study on this topic found that 35% of American teens have been misled by fake AI content, and 22% have shared misinformation without realizing it (Common Sense Media, 2024). And it’s not just children, it’s everyone. Most people cannot distinguish AI generated content from their counterpart (Köbis, Doležalová, & Soraperra, 2021). The big takeaway from this study is that teens are untrained. They live in a world where dopamine beats truth. They aren’t taught how to slow down, question, and verify information. Studies show that teaching teens “lateral reading,” which is quickly checking a source’s credibility in new tabs, can double their ability to spot misinformation (Wineburg & McGrew, 2019). A more recent study (Breakstone et al., 2021\) demonstrated that short online classes on lateral reading improved student’s ability to evaluate sources, with scores nearly doubling after training.

## **Where Lies the Problem?**

While the Stanford study shows what teens struggle with, Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and researcher at NYU (New York University), shows *why*. He argues that the reason behind the lack of critical thinking has to do with social media itself, specifically algorithms. Haidt studied how technology reshapes the way we think, and especially how it erodes our ability to reason, reflect, and disagree without getting angry. In his 2022 Atlantic article, “Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Have Been Uniquely Stupid,” he doesn’t mean people got dumber. He means our tools got worse, especially social media. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube rewired us. They transformed how teens engage with information: prioritizing performance (posting to gain approval), popularity (sharing what feels true over what is true), and polarization (treating disagreement as a threat rather than an opportunity to learn).

Teens were born into this. Haidt points to 2012–2013 as the tipping point, when smartphones and social media became normal for teens. Right after this turning point symptoms such as anxiety, loneliness, and polarization exploded. Algorithms don’t just feed us random stuff, they trap us in emotional loops. Helping teens understand that their feed is a “persuasive design” as opposed to a  neutral window that helps build resistance to manipulation (UNESCO, 2021). The algorithm finds posts to reinforce your beliefs, and no one questions it — that’s where critical thinking dies. Not because teens are lazy, but because the environment makes deep thinking feel impossible. Haidt says this isn’t just about mental health, but about the collapse of shared reality. When we can’t agree on facts, when we see anyone who disagrees as evil or stupid, democracy crumbles. Teens are a key example of this, and it’s rapidly changing, and not for the better. 

Haidt provides some simple solutions including limiting screen time, restoring unstructured play, and allowing teens to experience boredom, the space where reflection begins.

On the other hand, one country that’s successfully teaching teens to withstand misinformation is Finland, where media literacy has been embedded across the national curriculum since 2013, it’s woven into literature, history, and even ethics. Students learn to ask questions. Because of this, Finland consistently ranks \#1 in Europe for resilience to disinformation according to the European Media Literacy Index (Open Society Institute – Sofia, 2023).  Through Finland’s education system we can see that once critical thinking is taught systematically by schools, parents, and society teens don’t just survive the digital world, They learn to see through it. 

## **The Solution**

American professor and author Tom Nichols offers a solution. In his book called *The Death of Expertise*  he perfectly describes the dangers of the post-truth environment. In this book Nichols argues that Western societies, especially the United States, are undergoing a dangerous cultural shift: the rejection of expertise and the elevation of personal opinion as equal to evidence-based knowledge. When teens outsource thinking to AI or search engines, they bypass the mental effort needed to build discernment. This “cognitive offloading,” where we forget what we can easily look up, confirms Nichols’ fear that convenience is replacing intellectual rigor (Sparrow et al., 2011). Like Haidt, Nichols understands this as a societal collapse.

Nichols’ proposed solution is both simple and straightforward. He emphasizes that parents should foster a respect for evidence among their high school adolescents, arguing that adults must model intellectual humility — the awareness of not knowing — in everyday life. This teaches their children to value curiosity over certainty. Another thing parents can do is rather than restricting screen time, they can practice “active mediation,” or discussing online content with teens to build critical habits (Livingstone et al., 2017). This dialogue-based approach is supported by quantitative research showing that active mediation is positively related to adolescents’ learning-related online activities (b \= 0.214, p \< 0.001). Crucially, the same study found that strict restrictive mediation was not significantly associated with learning-related use, proving that simply limiting screen time will not always build productive digital habits (Lu et al., 2022). After all, a teens critical thinking isn’t about being right, it’s about being willing to learn. 

## **Conclusion**

In a world where a digital environment engineered to hijack our attention and disconnect us from the self is pushed globally, critical thinking is our last line of defense, especially for teens. The 2016 Stanford study revealed the symptom, concluding that teens aren’t lazy; they're oblivious to the dangers. Haidt shows the danger, presenting how social media causes deep thinking to be nearly impossible. The solution, according to Tom Nichols, lies within humility, curiosity, and courage, to say "I don't know” and seek evidence regardless, hinting that the first step to thinking critically is asking questions.

Parents are uniquely positioned to do this, not by banning phones, but by creating space for conversation, teaching lateral reading, teaching, and asking, “who made this, and why?” In a world that’s engineered to distract and manipulate, small acts like this are revolutionary. They don’t just protect teens from misinformation, they help rebuild the version of society where truth still matters.

# ***Student Group 2: Authoritarianism and Resistance in Indonesia 2025***

# The Wrath of Prabowo: An Ethical Analysis Of Political Instability and Resistance in Indonesia 2025 

Kian Allen (16 years)

In 2025, Indonesians began a powerful movement against president Prabowo Subianto after he raised the rent prices by ten times. According to Helen Regan (2025) of CNN, this sparked immediate backlash in Jakarta as citizens already struggle with unemployment. Prabowo also raised food prices and this led to people believing that he was also raising inequality of the average citizen compared to a politician. Many viewed this policy as proof that the government was out of touch with its people. For citizens, this was more than an economic issue, it symbolizes neglect and injustice, fueling anger that quickly turned into organized resistance. This analysis introduces the question: was this decision by the president wrong or was it thought through? Are the citizens wrong for questioning their government? In order to evaluate this question we will consider the approaches of several different ethical philosophers such as Hannah Arendt, James Green Wood, Jennifer Kling & Megan Mitchel. 

 The protests grew larger after the death of a 21 year old Gojek driver Affan Kurniawan. who was killed by a police vehicle during a demonstration. As Anne Barker (2025) of ABC explains, Kurnaiwa's death became a powerful symbol of state violence, sparking outrage nationwide. Videos on his final moments spread rapidly across Tik Tok and other big platforms, and this is what started the nationwide mourning and rage. To many Indonesians, Affan represented the ordinary worker; young, poor and struggling; whose life was cut short by an unaccountable state. 

Affan's death became a global symbol; as Petty (2025) notes, students in Jakarta started carrying around a photo of Affan. Chanting his name and showing how a single death can lead to a collapse in society, these emotional protests soon turned violent, escalating into riots. Clashes with riot police occurred frequently, and in some cases, the rioters would loot the houses of the government buildings, attack police stations and even burn vehicles to show their frustration. These actions drew global media attention, although they also allowed the state to justify a harsher crackdown.

According to Greenwood (2023) *Justifying violent protest*, acts of violence in protest  movements often come from desperation rather than aggression. He explains that when peaceful methods are ignored or punished, citizens begin to see force as the only response. In Indonesia, many protesters felt their demands were being silenced, so violence became a way to reclaim agency and force the government to acknowledge their pain. 

The president's reaction was ruthless and forceful. Police arrested more than 1200 people in Jakarta alone, with reports of being beaten or intimidated by the policemen Petty (2025). Prabowo justified this move to “restore peace”, framing the protesters as criminals.

Although this force did not silence the movement, it instead deepened the public's sense of injustice. Social media allowed people to share images of police violence, countering the government's move on “restoring peace.” The hashtag \#JusticeforAffan trended nationally for weeks keeping people's attention on the protests. 

Despite force and violence, the protests proved effective, Prabowo revoked the house allowance when he was forced to respond under pressure. Regan (2025), notes that these movements were most effective when the citizens worked together; but many protesters saw this as too late.

However, violent acts weakened the movement. Looting and clashes with police made it so that the government could brand the protesters as criminals, and this reduced a lot of public sympathy among groups. As Petty (2025) notes, while many Indonesians cared for Affan's passing, not everyone supported the destruction of property. Violence made it possible for the government to increase repression under the claim of “maintaining order”.

Hannah Arendt (1958) once said, "violence can destroy, but can't really create it.” From her point of view, the people in Indonesia might have started using violence because they felt desperate and unheard, but it actually weakened their ability to make a real change, instead of helping their message, it gave the government a reason to shut them down. 

Another thing that held them back was the lack of strong leadership. While this made it more accessible and harder to uncover, it also meant that there was nobody who even considered negotiating with the president or coming up with a way they could get what they both wanted. 

As Kling & Mitchell (2022) argue in *The Philosophy of Protest,* real change needs more than anger, it needs organization and a clear sense of purpose. They write that protests are most powerful when people have a shared goal and know exactly what they're fighting for. In Indonesia's case, the anger and emotion were strong, but because there wasn't a structure of leadership, the government could easily call the movement chaotic instead of serious. 

These events reveal the paradox of resistance in Indonesia: unified protests can force governments to give in to public demands, but violent acts and decisions and government crackdowns can weaken the movements ability to keep a long term change. On one hand, Prabowo was pressured into reversing a crucial decision. On the other hand, the government showed all the cracks in its system on the topic of repression. The paradox also raises questions about who was right and who was wrong. Both the citizens and the president made ethical mistakes. However, the president's use of force was particularly unjust. 

The 2025 protests in Indonesia reveal how anger and inequality can erupt into a national movement, uniting diverse groups of citizens. They also show how the death of one individual can evolve into extreme repression and riots. While protesters succeeded in forcing transparency, the combination of violence and resistance created a cut down in long term effectiveness. According to Petty (2025). The movement's greatest asset may not be its immediate impact but its demonstrations that Indonesia will challenge authorities and unite.

Why did the citizens choose to use violence instead of trying to negotiate peace? When people take to the streets in anger, we must first ask what injustice led them there. Violence, in nearly every case, is not born out of hatred for peace, but out of despair at silence. 

“Those who make peaceful revolutions impossible will make violent revolutions inevitable.” In the words of Kennedy (1962) If citizens feel unheard, if they believe that petitions are ignored, that protests are dismissed, that the ballot no longer carries meaning, then they begin to believe violence is the only way they can make their pain visible. Violence then becomes the language of the voiceless. It is not chosen, it is forced. This also relates to Martin Luther King Jr's thoughts on equality and inequality. 

Dr King once said “a riot is the language of the unheard.” (King 1967). This reflects the situation in Indonesia 2025; citizens turn to violence not out of hatred, but because they feel ignored and powerless under a government that refuses to listen. He believed that lasting peace can only come through fairness and understanding, not through silence or suppression. 

In the end movements against Prabowo show both potential and the limits of popular resistance. They show that citizens can take power quickly and win small victories but it also shows us that without leadership, strategy and persistence, the movement risks being trapped by the very system they seek to transform.

These philosophers ask the ethical question of who is right and wrong. When applied to Indonesia 2025, their theories clearly lead to one answer and that is that the president's decision to ignore the protests and not take initiative was wrong. Although the philosophers would not necessarily condone the destruction of the rioting, or the looting of many houses, they would condone the right to take to the streets and fight for their rights. On the other hand the decisions that the president made are ethically problematic. And these moral philosophers would oppose his decisions with passion.

# Indonesia’s Elite Continuity and Democratic Vulnerability

Walden Gray (17 years)

## **Introduction:** 

The Indonesian political instability started with the election of president Prabowo, an ex-Suharto elite, and culminated with the death of three government officials after a food delivery driver was run over by a military vehicle. This analysis studies the catalyst of the 2025 Indonesian political unrest, and more specifically the use of this political instability as a tool for authoritarian regression. The research question used to study this topic is: how elite continuity uses political instability as a tool for authoritarian regression? As a lens this reports ties in the political theoretic work of Antonio Gramsci, and his concept of hegemony, in which instability acts as a tool for elites to coerce the population, and Sameul P. Huntington proposes the idea of political decay, in which weak institutions provide opportunity for authoritarian powers to take control. 

## **Context:** 

Indonesian political tensions rose over the course of 2025 after President Prabowo created new policies that created a feared echo of Indonesia's authoritarian past. This fear was reinforced when Probowo announced a military expansion, in which the military would expand to have greater influence in civilian affairs. (Lamb & Doherty, 2025\) His integration of the military in civilian affairs starts with creation of a hundred new military battalions set to assist in civilian roles, such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and food security. The protests started as peaceful demonstrations during mid August 2025 due to: corruption, inflation, and budget cuts to vital systems. Although, the primary cause for the demonstrations was an outrage towards the increased MP housing allowance of 3000 USD per month, which was nearly 10 times the minimum wage. The protests escalated after the death of a food delivery driver, who was run over by a special forces vehicle, and (Livingstone, 2025\) culminated when a parliament house was burnt down causing the death of three people. (McNamee, 2025\) 

President Prabowo responded to the protests by labelling them as acts of treason and terrorism, and ordering the military, and police, to take firm action. (Livingstone, 2025\) 

This is not simply a political chaos, but in fact a deeper historical pattern repeating itself, not simply protesting caused by an mp housing allowance, but an accumulation of growing unrest towards an weak institution that is failing to meet the growth pace of the people. This causes instability, which is furthered by the fear of recession to authoritarian rule, which causes further instability, and paradoxically creates a justification for elites to return to authoritarian policies. 

## **Evaluating sources:** 

The sources used in this study cover a wide breadth of academic credibility and bias. From the foundational texts of political theorists Antonio Gramsci (1971) and Sameul P. Huntington, who provide academically supported theoretical frameworks, to supporting journalists such as The Guardian’s Helen Livingstone, (2025) Lamb and Doherty, (2025) BBC’s Michael S. McNamee, (2025) or CNA’s Nivell Rayda (2025) who all provide valuable factual timed reporting on the 2025 protests. These sources all pose a western view point, which is where the work of local journalists, such as Vice’s Arzia Wargadiredja, (2025) or East Asia Forum's Fadhilah Primandari, (2025) come in to provide a valuable cross culture perspective, though their work should be taken cautiously, as they are not part of a peer reviewed organization. Equivalently, Heryanto and Hadiz (2005) offer a peer reviewed work on post authoritarian Indonesia, which strengthens Huntington's argument, and provides a local, but highly credible, viewpoint. This report balances credible academic sources with accurate time stamped reports from both local and international journalists. 

## **Theoretical Framework:** 

To ground the Indonesian case, and build a credible foundation this report uses two political theorists who pose that instability is a tool for authoritarianism: Firstly, Antonio Gramsci, who poses the theory of Hegemony, which can be simplified into two ways in which a dominant class maintains power. First, is the use of constant to indirectly maintain dominance of a state through values and ideas. This is done through institutions, such as school, media and religion. The second part of Gramsci's Hegemony is Coercion, which is the state's form of direct control, e.g. police, and military. As gramsci argues coercion appears when constant breaks down and when the only method for control left is coercion. (Gramsci, 1971\)

Secondly, Samuel P. Huntington, who argues the concept of political decay, which he states occurs when social mobilization outpaces the political mobilization of the state. He argues that when this social aspect increases more rapidly than its institutional counterpart the state fails to meet the social demands of the people, which then creates political instability. This instability then allows for a strongman to take power and restore “order”(Huntington, 1968\)

Both Huntington and Gramsci explain how disorder can sustain elite power, which ties, and can be applied directly to the 2025 Indonesian case.

## **Implication:**

How the reconfiguration of  New Order elites leaves the democracy susceptible to authoritarian regression? The current Indonesian leaders and officials, as commented on by Heryanto & Hadiz, are in fact not new democratic voices, but rather re-branded Suharto era officials, who have primarily remained in power. (Heryanto & Hadiz, 2005\) The democracy’s foundations being built upon the reconfiguration of corrupt officials leaves it shallow and vulnerable to authoritarian regression. Furthermore, this foundational weakness of democracy causes political instability, which in itself can be used by elites to justify a return to authoritarian ways. (Gramsci, 1971\) 

To further support this, the government's reaction to the protests, being called terrorism and treason, is a direct example of Huntington's justification. This reaction, against primarily unarmed protesters, causes fear among human rights movements at the severity of the reaction. (Livingstone, 2025\) The protests can be used as means to further solidify military control, and as argued by (Huntington, 1968), when a country is in a state of turmoil it gives power to the establishment to impose authoritarian policies in the name of order. Although, political unrest aids authoritarianism by making the people desire the order brought by it. When a state is unstable and in political turmoil ,economic and social development cannot occur. This mixed with a constant uncertainty and fear of the populace, who would begin to feel that peace, and economic growth, should be achieved by any means necessary, can lead to the population welcoming the order brought by authoritarian rule. (Huntington, 1968\) This is supported as well by Heryanto & Hadiz, (2005) who argue that the people begin to long for a “strong ruler.” This is further supported by Arzia Wargadiredja, (2017) who argues that the current Indonesian youth are starting to feel nostalgic for the security of the New Order era regime. This directly shows Huntington's theory, and as commented on by Fadhilah Primandari, (2025) 64.9 percent of Indonesians value economic growth rather than the freedom of democracy, which further supports Huntington's argument. 

This is how instability is used as a tool for authoritarianism. Protesting creates justification that can back oligarchical elites to make stricter policies in the name of restoring order, and use the fear of the people to reassert power.

## **Conclusion:** 

In conclusion, political instability seen in Indonesia, framed through the works of Gramsci and Huntington and commented on by Heryanto & Hadiz, is not an incidental crisis, but rather the only logical outcome of a deep failure of false institutional change. Indonesian democracy lies susceptible to regression, because the institution itself has stayed the same. The foundations of the institutions being built upon Suharto era officials confirms Heryanto and Hadiz’s argument that the democracy was shallow from the beginning. This continuity of leadership shows Huntington's political decay, where weakness creates disorder, which can be exploited by elites. The instability acts as a tool for the elites to justify restoring order, and in reality a justification to impose authoritarian policies, Gramsci’s coercion. Ultimately, this goes to show that post authoritarian Indonesia's democracy is not as strong as is believed. 

The Indonesian case serves as a vital example to countries fighting the battle of authoritarianism, to show that although its chains of control have been cast free, regression still poses a danger. In terms of the future, Indonesia stands at a junction, between regression, and true democratic growth. The future will be determined by the strength of the movements in the name of democracy.

# What can the current social movement in Indonesia learn from educational and cultural social movement theory? 

Jaiah Hazel (18 years)

Disclaimer: As the events discussed continue to evolve, this information may be outdated.

## **Introduction**

As protests persist and unrest intensifies, the future of Indonesia remains uncertain. Reflecting a long standing anger at corruption and repression, Indonesians demand deep, structural change including economic shifts, clear, credible democracy, and accountability for the injustices that have taken place. As of now, the government's response has mainly consisted of symbolic promises and surface-level reforms, leaving a tension between the people's demands and the government's persistent inaction. While the issue was initially seen as a domestic struggle, recent events such as the death of Gojek driver Affan Kurniawan have drawn international attention. Thus, the world is watching, and with it, the eyes of those who have been subjected to the same kind of violence. While there are a myriad of people, both well-known, or forgotten in memory, who have experienced ruling class subordination, the focus of this research draws to the works of Paulo Freire and Pramoednya Ananta Toer as examples of individuals who used education and literature as tools to inspire and sustain social movements for governmental change. 

## **What changes have the people demanded & what has the government done?** 

In an attempt to curate a united and cohesive list of demands people put together the “17+8 demands,” that best sum up the unmet needs of Indonesians. According to the Asia Pacific Solidarity Network (APSN 2025), it contained 17 short term goals for the government to follow through before September 5th, and 8 long term goals to work on future structural reform. It can be summed up into five main aspects. First, Indonesians demand a fair economy for the people. Vedi. R Hadiz, an influential scholar in Southeast Asian political economy, released a 2010 book called ‘Localising Power in Post Authoritarian Indonesia’, which argues that Indonesia's post 1998 democracy and decentralization efforts were largely captured by elites who found new ways to keep the old system running. 

This demand contains a desire to cut MP (members of parliament) and elite benefits. CNA Singapore broadcast (Asian news network 2025\) noted MP’s high perks and $3,000/month housing allowance, aligning with people’s demand to cut wasteful spending. Y.J.P. Kurniawati et al. released an academic paper (2024) which accredits this by connecting tax reform to how Indonesians' fiscal system currently benefits elites. 

Second, the people ask for affordable daily life. Imran, Local Indonesian and member of the protests, states that the protests are arising from economic hardship and frustration with living conditions (Al Jazeera 2025). Asia Pacific Solidarity network (APSN 2025\) lists concrete demands for lower food, fuel, transport prices, and minimum wage increases in line with inflation, backing up the lists legitimacy. 

The third demand is real democracy and freedom of peoples’ voices. CCPR center (UN center for civil and political rights) recommends freedom of expression and protest, showing that International actors are echoing these same demands (CCPR center, march 2024). 

This concurs with the fourth demand, which is justice and accountability for the protest deaths and police violence that have taken place. Asia Pacific Solidarity (APSN 2025\) specifically demands justice for protest victims like Affan Kurniawan. Similarly, ASEAN MP (aseanmp march 2025\) had already called for International lawmakers to end police brutality prior to the August escalation. Amnesty International ([Amnesty](http://Amnesty.org) 2022\) also wrote that the Kuruan stadium tragedy shows long standing anger toward police misuse of tear gas, illustrating that the call for accountability has been thus far unanswered. 

Lastly, people are after a deep reform of the DPR (dewan perwakilan rakyat, which translates to the people's representative council of Indonesia), and political parties that lead with a clean, transparent government (Asia pacific solidarity network 2025). This encompasses the strengthening of anti corruption institutions like KPK (komisi pemberantasan korupsi, which translates to corruption eradication commission), judiciary, and oversight bodies. CCPR center (CCPR center march 2024\) had long urged Institutional reform, anti-corruption, and government accountability, reflecting ongoing demands Indonesians continue to seek. 

Asia Pacific Solidarity Network (APSN 2025\) confirms only three of the 17 short-term demands were more or less met; freezing increases in allowance, new DPR facilities, and encouraging DPR’s ethical council to investigate problems. APS and CNA (2025) report partial action on allowances but no salary cuts or deeper reforms. CNA Singapore directly reports Prabowos’ cabinet reshuffle, however, the source interprets this as political alignment rather than reform. Moreover, Dr. Ivanovich Agusta confirms the protests have widely been viewed as a signal of the widening socio economic gap in Indonesia, (IPB university, 2025). 

Instagram accounts under the name ‘bergerak’ (translating directly into “to move,”) made by Diaspora and locals of Indonesia, along with as the One Piece flag which became a cultural symbol, show domestic and International pressure that pushed the government to act (symbolically or minimally). While social media accounts are often prone to bias, during current events they can be used as an accurate lens into the people's perspective. The government promises democratic reform, yet Freedom House (2025) ranks Indonesia as 'Partly Free,' as of 2025\. How is the gap between rhetoric and reality accounted for? 

## **Freire and Toer’s wisdom**

The works of Freire and Toer converge on the principle that liberation requires both consciousness and structure. Brazilian educator and philosopher Paulo Freire believed in conscientização (critical consciousness) meaning oppressed people must become aware of their oppression and act to change it (Freire, 1970). Along with this, Freire constantly reiterated the idea of ‘revolutionary love’, meaning this critical consciousness must include ultimate compassion for all, including enforces of the corrupt system (1970). 

Pramoedya's Buru Quartet, composed orally during fourteen years of imprisonment (1965-1979), set during the Dutch colonial period of the early 1900s, documents the birth of Indonesian nationalism through characters who experience colonial education, economic exploitation, and political repression, reflects the persistence of authoritarianism and inequality to even present day Indonesia. In parallel with Freire, his character Minke's journey in *Footsteps* shows how true liberation requires dismantling the fundamental, corrupt relationships between oppressed and oppressor, without the use of violence (1985). 

This suggests a longstanding pattern in the relationship between political power and economic interests in Indonesia that stems from the pre 1998 New Order era, implying again that elite corruption has not changed, but wears a new mask.  

With the idea of a necessary structural shift, international pressure can help, yet only if it’s backed by domestic power (Freire, 1970). International bodies serve their own interests, and what is most important is the locals and diaspora documenting and sharing their stories, as demonstrated throughout *This Earth of Mankind* where protagonist Minke uses writing to advocate for indigenous voices and build Indonesian national consciousness (Toer, 1980). 

## **Conclusion** 

Pramoedya's lived experience aligns with Freire's pedagogical insights. According to their teachings, it is suggested that Indonesia’s movement must move into a combination of Freirean education for critical consciousness with Toer’s cultural storytelling to sustain organization, dignity, and identity over time, without needing riots or ferocity. From the abovementioned, the bergerak network, 17+8 demands, and cultural symbols like the One Piece flag, are all aligned with both Freire’s and Toer’s teachings. However, movements that raise awareness but don’t build structures for sustained action do not transform (Freire, 1970). Riots make visible violence that was already there, but as suggested through Minke's evolution from student to journalist in *This Earth of Mankind* and *Footsteps*, violence itself has severe limitations as a strategy for liberation (Toer, 1980-1985). Movements must maintain ‘revolutionary love’ (Freire, *1*970); fierce and uncompromising in its commitment to justice, not dehumanizing even those who oppress it.

# Student Reflections

The ideal outcome of education is not to create an efficient tool, but a complete and ingenious human being. Genius is in all of us; its literal meaning is “seed.” The heights of the mind are reached only through the depths of self-knowledge, which is found only in environments that cherish non-linear and personal exploration directly alongside rigorous study. 

*The prompt: “Please write a short passage reflecting on your experience of the last two months researching, studying, writing, and working together.”*

# **Tommy (14 years)**

The last month has been one of – if not the single – most influential periods of my education. I have been lucky enough to work with a team of dedicated, passionate thinkers who continually impress me with their writing skills and intellect, as well as teachers who expertly guide my learning journey. 

Analyzing sources and weaving them into comprehensible essays in timed as well as untimed essays has proven to be a massively important step for my advancement from a student to a researcher. Writing essays such as these has helped build my capability to provide academic analysis and create real and meaningful research.

Working alongside my class has further shown me what it means to be a researcher. Merging our essay premises for a group multimedia presentation hasn’t just been a good exercise, it’s been a ton of fun – and it’s built a strong sense of comradery and friendship between me and my classmates. In addition to that, our specific topics for the aforementioned group project have given me a grasp on the crazy digital world we find ourselves in today, and recognizing the difficulties and stresses that are prevalent in wider education has helped me to become a more knowledgeable and happier person.

I should also note that it’s been a great pleasure to read through Dr. J’s own history of human civilization: *A Conscious History of Consciousness*. It’s such a refreshing experience to find myself under the guidance of teachers/mentors that value contextual, three-dimensional learning instead of rote memorization. The book has also been super enjoyable, and I look forward to more\! Bravo Dr. Julian, you did a really good job with that one.

In conclusion, it’s been super fun and educational so far, and I can’t wait for it to continue. Definitely my favorite school experience full stop.

Initially, I had a vague idea that I was curious about politics to get my mind off of a difficult situation I was going through at the time. But while my paper focuses on the current Indonesian political corruption, it ended up being about so much more than just that. Instead of my pain points being something I avoided, they became something that allowed me to compassionately connect with those facing the struggle. Instead of my emotions being disconnected from my work, I was guided to harness that passion into my writing and findings. 

The meticulous research process was intense and challenging at times; I had to add and delete repeatedly, even add in a whole new section close to the deadline, but it served so much growth. I learned how to research, fact check, and speak my truth confidently, creating claims that are passionate as well as evidence-based. Rather than feeling disconnected from the work as I thought, I found myself increasingly driven by the feeling of connection I created with my research. Now, when I look at a personal or worldly interest or problem, I see how to dive into the sea of information and explore the variable research and opinions out there. 

Not only was this an intellectual growth point, but also a personal one. I was able to fuse the depth in my own life with the situations in the world in a sourced and academic way. This synthesis may be one of the most important things I have learned, and I will always carry it with me.

“I thought the IRR was pretty intense work because I had never done so much research or writing in my life. But I had learnt a lot and I feel happy that I took the time to process all the information and that we had enough time for it. I really liked using philosophers in my text, it kinda made the text feel more alive and I feel I needed that. I wish I had a bit more time to add other perspectives because that's another aspect I feel my text lacks. 

I've never really done a text on politics and it's a nice change. I really liked the process of my IRR because it was genuinely fun although it was tough and definitely stressful. I look back at it in a great way as I have learnt to open new doorways. I loved when we traveled to the beach for a week and worked together on a trip, it was easier to think in a space that was more open. I really liked the idea of having a team, this made me feel a lot less stressed. The way we learn in Dr. J’s school is very different from my other schools. I learnt a lot more in a day than I have in years at other schools.”

“Since I started my journey as one of Dr. Julian’s students (a year ago) I've noticed major improvements in my knowledge on history, my skills in writing, and even human nature through psychology. Not only are my skills developing, but also my love for what we do. I deeply enjoy our lectures, lessons, and conversations we have as a group. 

With minimal knowledge on our subjects when I started, I was partially skeptical and pretty nervous. But over the course of the program my love and enthusiasm for the project has grown a lot. It has also transferred into my day to day life, providing me a different perspective on what drives society, increasing my vocabulary, and making me more open to new adventures and possibilities. 

History has been one of my favorites. I really enjoy learning about how human civilization has developed over the years and especially the psychology behind it, how religion developed, the empires and dynasties clashing for power, the growth of trade and the discoveries of new countries and continents. It’s shown me how we got where we are in a unique and entertaining way. An example of one of our lessons is where we sit in a group looking at a map while Julian shows us the specific areas of countless powers, where they migrated, where they fought, and much more. As I’m Dutch, learning about the VOC and the founding of essentially the modern stock market together with many other innovations and inventions was also super interesting.

My improvements in the English language have also helped me navigate the social aspect of my life. I’ve noticed my vocabulary, sentence structure, and diction have expanded beyond my expectations. We read assigned books on human nature, philosophy, psychology, and more, which has greatly improved my overall language skills. Through this process, I discovered that I love writing research papers about topics I’m passionate about, as it strengthens my writing and expands my knowledge. 

I’m excited to see what the future of this program will have in store for me and my classmates, so far it’s been super enjoyable and incredibly helpful. I'm developing my interests and skills, along with growing my knowledge of modern society and the world of AI through Dr. Julian’s knowledge. I find that the ETI program has a really nice balance between classic yet fun AP studies while still keeping it modern and using technology to our advantage in a way that helps us improve and work efficiently. A big thanks to teacher Dr. Julian and my classmates Julian, Jaiah, Aiden, Kian, and Tommy for being part of this group. I'm really looking forward to what’s to come\!”

“I have always been good at absorbing information, whether that is our history work, random facts about a movie franchise such as Star Wars or different battles of World War II. Either way, it’s safe to say that my mind seems to retain a large score of random information it finds interest in. This is why our research appealed to me, because  it allowed my brain to go on a tangent and charge down every single mental path of an idea to the bitter end, find sources or ideas that further complexify them, and sometimes completely lose where I started. 

While this is fun and thought provoking it’s not a great research strategy for AP Seminar where you have to stay focused on one research lens. In the beginning I actually found myself completely lost in a mind maze of information and drowning in sources, all while researching a topic I thought was fairly refined. I liked absorbing information, but this was my limit. I had to completely change gears multiple times and, with the help of Doctor Julian, turn my ideas into a realistic workload. 

These are some of the skills that I had to learn over the course of this month: 1\) How to stay on track and refine an argument or idea into something that can be realistically researched. 2\) How to develop an interesting argument without going on every possible research tangent. And honestly, it went really well. It was definitely a learning curve, and involved many massive content cuts, but in the end I came out with an essay that I'm genuinely happy with, and that says a lot because I'm very critical of my work. 

Not only this, but the process of refining and cutting content mid research allowed me to have great references and information for our group's upcoming oral presentation. Another major skill that this month of research helped me to develop is constructive debate. To help refine our ideas and even find them in the first place, my group – me, Kian, and Jaiah – needed to debate, not to prove our points right but to strengthen them. 

Ultimately, this month has both tested and grown my critical thinking, debate skills, my team work, and lastly, my organization and focusing skills.”

# **Aiden (16 years)**

“My time at ETI may have been short, but it has helped me progress significantly, both intellectually and spiritually. 1 day of learning with Dr. J feels like 3 weeks at my previous school. I feel so blessed and welcome to be here. I can express my emotions freely and deeply, and because my teacher has a deep understanding of people, I genuinely feel heard. ETI is not only a powerful space for learning intellectually, but an overall development for who you are and who you want to become. Even in this short time, I’ve realized that education is far more than knowledge – it's about growth, understanding, and becoming the best version of yourself. Being a part of ETI has shown me that real learning begins when the mind and heart work together.

ETI has taught me to think beyond the surface. When researching, we're not just reading text – we're questioning the writer’s rhetoric, their purpose, exploring their emotions, and connecting that to previous studies. This approach to learning encourages deeper thought and genuine curiosity, something many schools often overlook. 

Every history lesson feels like a doorway into layers of understanding I didn’t know existed. Dr. J always provides a vivid picture of what he is describing. This form of education brings me into a space where I genuinely learn what is being taught rather than simply memorizing. 

Beyond academics, ETI has helped me grow on a deeper, more personal level – the deep conversations, reflection, even meditation. It’s made me more aware of my thoughts, emotions, and the energy I bring into every situation. The world is becoming increasingly chaotic and unstable, but with the help of spiritual and emotional awareness, we can bring back a sense of peace and liberty. 

When I first joined ETI – like most people – I was quiet. I mostly listened and rarely ever spoke.  But that shyness quickly faded as I started to understand and talk to my classmates more often. As time went on, I realized how wonderful my class truly was – filled with laughter, joy, and relatability. Unlike my previous schools, every day at ETI is a day where we help each other out, form a strong community, and build ourselves higher and higher with the support of our friends.  

When I think about the future, I know everything I learned at ETI will stay with me. All the knowledge I have and will learn will not fade away; it will stick with me forever. It taught me how to be confident, how to connect with others and how to grow beyond my limits. As I move forward, I’ll carry the lessons, memories, and friendships I've built here. ETI has shown me that learning never truly ends, it just changes shape as we continue to grow.
