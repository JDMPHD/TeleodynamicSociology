Aiden: I understand that morning sky’s work is radical yet unsupported of evidence. Wait let me send you a voice note because it’s hard to say this.
Aiden: Crap, I accidentally deleted it 😂 I’ll re do it.
 [5 minute Voice note]
Julian: I don't know that he's an evil manipulator. I haven't watched his videos or read more of his material (I asked you to send to me previously).
Aiden: Oh you did?
Julian: My concern is that his work represents a "reality tunnel" that is not supported by evidence.
Aiden: Yeah I see.
Julian: He may have a good heart. And his energy clearly speaks to yours. There are different possibilities as to why his energy speaks to yours. I would have to see more of his presence to form an educated opinion. My concern is the effect on your sense of truth and judgment, and your ability to judge reality on an evidence basis.
Aiden: I get it.
Julian: You say he encourages you to challenge his thinking and find out for yourself, and to research. But the books you are reading are part of the same reality tunnel.
You know I am far from loyal to the mainstream. But I am loyal to true science. Because that is not a belief system. Is it a method of testing our beliefs. I am trying to teach you that loyalty, because it keeps us sane and smart.
It's not enough if something "calls to you". It needs to be tested with evidence, or you could get lost. You understand I apply the same thing to my work, including my deepest intuitions.
My intuitions tell me WHERE to look. But I don't BELIEVE it without scientific evidence. Do you understand the difference?
This way we stay together. We don't just wander off into our own reality tunnels. This way, we are all together answering to Truth - not shattering reality into our private feelings. That's where things get crazy.
Is it possible that in prehistory, widespread civilizations existed, and we have lost their traces? I think it is possible. Do I think aliens are out there? Do I think there are forms of communication that modern science hasn't unlocked? I think both of those things are likely. And I can explain why, on a scientific basis of evidence.
But unless a person has evidence for something, then all their claims about Knowing What's True ultimately are a private reality tunnel, and that's rather dangerous to themselves and others, whether they have a good heart or not.
It is natural to be hungry for myth, when you have been raised in a mythically orphaned culture.
The issue is the confusion between material reality and mythic resonance.
I hope you can take some time and consider what I'm telling you, with the understanding that it is 💯 for your growth and safety.
Aiden: oh my… sorry i went out to get snacks 😭
Julian: No worries man
Aiden: that’s a lot of text
Julian: Well, read it carefully. It's not for my own amusement.
Aiden: i know, thank you for this
Julian: I am responsible for you in this way. This is my responsibility.
Aiden: ♥️

[12/31/2025, 4:06 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Hello Akasha! How's it going?
I'm a little concerned about Aiden's engagement with the Morning Sky and Ancient Aliens reality tunnel. I don't want to embarrass him so please keep this between us for now, but I wanted to get your thoughts and also whether this is something that's on Shanti's radar.
[12/31/2025, 4:20 PM] Akasha: [1:30 min voicenote]
[12/31/2025, 4:34 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I will send you the concerns as I see them
[12/31/2025, 4:36 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: It isn't really about whether I "approve." It is about my responsibility for the development of the clarity of his mind and knowledge process.
[12/31/2025, 4:37 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: So I will send you what I communicated to him, which expresses exactly what I see and why it concerns me in that regard.
[12/31/2025, 4:38 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: "My concern is that his work represents a "reality tunnel" that is not supported by evidence.

[12/31/2025, 4:41 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Critical and evidence based thinking is part of the job description.
[12/31/2025, 4:52 PM] Akasha: Thanks for sending this. It is very helpful. I will contemplate to see if I can find a way to approach him. He is very influenced by Luke who is arriving tomorrow for a month. Luke (30 yrs. old) II believe he has influenced Aiden’s interest in this “tunnel”. So that complicates things. People must be free to explore and go down the various rabbit holes. It would be great if he could find something to explore that qualified as being science based in your eyes. I am so glad that he is interested in something besides violent screen games. I see that as the most harmful thing that they are both engaged in.
[12/31/2025, 4:53 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Science, for me, is not a matter of content. It is a matter of method.
[12/31/2025, 4:54 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: It is possible to approach aliens or ancient civilizations with a scientific method also.
[12/31/2025, 4:57 PM] Akasha: I would love to have a talk with you about the subject of true science. I think there are a whole lot of things that are real but science hasn’t caught up with them yet. What do you think of Graham Hancock for example, and his book Fingerprints of the Gods?
[12/31/2025, 4:57 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I haven't read the book in full, only seen documentaries and read about it.
[12/31/2025, 4:57 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: The documentaries I've seen were full of fallacies and sensational reporting.
[12/31/2025, 4:58 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This is a red flag.
[12/31/2025, 4:58 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Of course, I completely agree about there being a ton that is real that science hasn't caught up with.
[12/31/2025, 4:58 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I am myself a scientist on that very edge.
[12/31/2025, 4:59 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: But when we operate on that edge, that it is when it is MOST important to practice "true science" - which means answering to truly rigorous accountability of evidence
[12/31/2025, 4:59 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: In the last year, I wrote my physics THREE times.
[12/31/2025, 4:59 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Because it was wrong twice.
[12/31/2025, 5:00 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I'll rewrite it again if I have to.
[12/31/2025, 5:00 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: That's science, yes? The feeling may point the way, but we bow to rigorous testing.
[12/31/2025, 5:03 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I can give you an example. I have a clear intuition that we humans are neither alone nor first.
[12/31/2025, 5:03 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: But what does that mean? Does it mean other civilizations have been on earth? Or are they elsewhere?
[12/31/2025, 5:04 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: If they are contacting us, are they physically here, or is that contact through some form of quantum entanglement or "phase resonance"?
[12/31/2025, 5:04 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Or are we really sensing patterns of consicousness in the deeper layers of reality? Not physical beings at all?
[12/31/2025, 5:04 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: These questions don't have obvious answers until we test and explore.
[12/31/2025, 5:05 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: When we settle on answers early because they sound good or someone said it confidently, that is bad science.
[12/31/2025, 5:07 PM] Akasha: As I said, I would love to have a talk at some point, if you want. I think my perspective is a little different and could be of value for you, as yours is for me.  It would be fun and challenging to see if we could understand each other.
[12/31/2025, 5:09 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: What I can say is that I operate at the absolute edge of what is considered possible within the rigorous scientific tradition.
[12/31/2025, 5:17 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: It does get lonely to break from a common ground of evidence. Then we no longer answer to the same ground, which can be disregulating and hazardous.
[12/31/2025, 5:17 PM] Akasha: You have a wonderful gift that is very valuable to mankind. You have chosen the path of rigorous science. Of course it’s not the only way to be of service to the world. I am still navigating my path, who I am and what is mine to do. It’s exciting as it unfolds. At the age of 60 I finally felt that I was “on purpose” and it is very satisfying. One priority is being a grandmother.I love letting my pathway unfold before me. I am happy that it led to you and this conversation at this moment.
[12/31/2025, 5:18 PM] Akasha: I am on my way now to a little NY event. Happy New Year and I’m looking forward to getting back to you in 2026! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
[12/31/2025, 5:19 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Wonderful!
[12/31/2025, 5:19 PM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Have a beautiful time and Happy new year!!!
[1/10, 7:47 AM] Akasha: Dear Dr. Julian, I’m happy to say that Luke, K & A’s trusted friend and mentor, is not encouraging the Morningstar obsession and Aiden is now talking about coding and other things aside from that. He did request a book by Zacharia Sitchken, I haven’t read him but I know a lot of people who have. I imagine that his theories stimulate the imagination. Any thoughts on this? Aiden is in any case very inspired by you and full of respect which comforts my heart. <3.
[1/10, 7:50 AM] Akasha: I just read this title by Paul Levy and thought of your work
What do Tibetan Buddhism and quantum physics have to do with each other?  
Did Tibetan Buddhists invent quantum physics (centuries before we even knew what it was)?
[1/10, 8:16 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Love this! you know I lived up among the Tibetan Buddhists for quite awhile. Up in Dharamsala and Ladakh. Beautiful tradition.
[1/10, 8:17 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I tend to agree that indigenous traditions saw fundamental reality much more accurately than modern reductionism. Now we are trying to bridge the two...
[1/10, 8:28 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: It's really great to hear that about Luke!

Well, looks like the same genre... Aiden knows my concerns about this genre and that I believe it is a compelling story but lacks empirical evidence.

It DOES stimulate the imagination, that's right. In fact, it feeds a hunger for myth and meaning. This hunger is real, is vital. Aiden is very familiar with my work on the topic, which discusses this deep human need - a need for connection which the modern world FAILS to meet.

The issue is that this approach confuses this need with evidence. It mixes layers of reality. I would argue that this leads to profound confusion and various levels of risks. I know that Aiden is very aware of my thoughts on it.

Of course I won't forbid him from reading, but I would suggest this hunger should be channeled differently. Mythic traditions and consciousness should be studied as what they are. History should be studied as what it is. And science should be studied as what it is. 

Aiden has a BEAUTIFUL drive for coherence. I would suggest this could be channeled into studying traditional wisdom and cosmology (like the Tibetans that you mentioned, as one example), and that it would be a tragedy if it fell instead into modern pseudoscience (which confuses these layers and refuses to make itself available to evidence or rigorous inquiry - that's why it gets stuck and cannot improve itself).
[1/10, 8:38 AM] Akasha: No I didn’t know that you lived with the Tibetans. What a great learning experience. Paul Levy became popular by writing the book Wetiko: Healing the Mind-Virus That Plagues Our World which really resonated with me. The term is from American indigenous wisdom. Then there’s a film I LOVE in which the KOGI people in the mountains of Colombia show that they know more about astronomy than prominent astronomers in London today with all their fancy equipment.
[1/10, 8:38 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yes! I was speaking to them about Wetiko just this week I think.
[1/10, 8:39 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: That is the type of book far more valuable for Aiden
[1/10, 8:40 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I value the London astronomers' equipment too. Their precise data is allowing me to form far more detailed models of the exact geometry and nature of reality.
[1/10, 8:41 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: That's the fusion that's possible. Science and vision, both. Each has value. Together, the value multiplies.
[1/10, 8:43 AM] Akasha: Yes but you have to admit that it is pretty impressive that the Kogi elders had this knowledge. That is what I believe we are capable of and what our culture has successfully distracted us from.
[1/10, 8:44 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I do admit it! The knowledge of traditional cultures is profound.
[1/10, 8:44 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: “I wanted to understand science because it gave me a new area to explore in my personal quest to understand the nature of reality. I also wanted to learn about it because I recognized in it a compelling way to communicate insights gleaned from my own spiritual tradition.”

— His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama
[1/10, 8:46 AM] Akasha: Good quote! Fusion is of course the way forward.. we don’t want to unlearn valuable modern knowledge.
[1/10, 8:47 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yes!
[1/10, 8:51 AM] Akasha: The question is how can we get Aiden interested in the subjects/books that we feel are most valuable for him. My interest was awakened as a teenager by North American Indian wisdom. The book Wetiko is a bit dry. And Luke told me that Morningstar is extremely charismatic and entertaining in his videos so that can be what got Aiden hooked.
[1/10, 8:53 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I can help provide material that is both engaging and deeply initiatory. I gave him one such book recently.
[1/10, 8:53 AM] Akasha: Oh right, at your birthday party.
[1/10, 8:53 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I think the key is for us to offer him clear and understanding communication about all this
[1/10, 8:54 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: That both validates the draw and explains our guidance
[1/10, 8:54 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: And helps him find beneficial paths
[1/10, 8:55 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: He is right to draw toward meaning structures that make sense, unlike modern reductionism
[1/10, 8:55 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: We need to help him find healthy ones to climb, not "coherence candy"
[1/10, 9:00 AM] Akasha: It’s important that I really understand you so we are on the same page. I loved the books by Doug Boyd called Mad Bear and Rolling Thunder. Doug was invited by these Indian leaders to write about them but he was only allowed to shadow them, to observe, and the books are his experiences and were very authentic. And easy to read. I will check out how A. is coming along with the book you gave him. I never see him reading…
[1/10, 9:01 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I was an apprentice of Martin Prechtel for yers.
[1/10, 9:01 AM] Akasha: OMG I love him!
[1/10, 9:02 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yes, these are my foundations. I am an heir and protector of indigenous and mythic wisdom.
[1/10, 9:02 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: You can ask Aiden about my dissertation work (or to see it yourself).
[1/10, 9:03 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I simply understand that deep knowledge is not separate from true science, and that true science is not reductionism.
[1/10, 9:03 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: The division is a false divide.
[1/10, 9:03 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: And it's meant to weaken us, not make us stronger.
[1/10, 9:03 AM] Akasha: Of course it is!
[1/10, 9:04 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I am here to help Aiden become both precise and profound. He is capable of it.
[1/10, 9:08 AM] Akasha: It’s just that true science is mixed up with terrible lies (as you well know) in this age of confusion. Aiden is a true seeker looking for what makes sense. And getting easily sidetracked.
[1/10, 9:10 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I do know. 100% know.
[1/10, 9:11 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: We get to pierce through the confusion on both sides with the clarity of our training and instincts ❤️
[1/10, 9:11 AM] Akasha: Wouldn’t this be a good book “Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: Memoirs from the Living Heart of a Mayan Village”
[1/10, 9:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: YES. I literally read this aloud to Julian, Jaiah, and Josh last year. The entire book. I have it.
[1/10, 9:14 AM] Akasha: Great!
[1/10, 9:17 AM] Akasha: If I remember correctly, Aiden’s dad really liked this book and it’s really important to get him on board. He’s pretty “off board” if you ask me 🙂 Encouraging Aiden with the Morningstar phenomenon…
[1/13, 10:38 AM] Akasha: It seems Aiden has listened deeply to you. He told us yesterday he was not listening to “the guy” (wouldn’t even say his name!) because it was not evidence based and he does not want to become a “max magnet of misinformation” (something like that). So one dilemma solved!!
[1/13, 10:40 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: So good! Let's channel that imagination toward grounded breakthroughs.
