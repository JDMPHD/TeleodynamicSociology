[1/15, 4:40 AM] Tommy Soares: Hey Julian!
[1/15, 4:40 AM] Tommy Soares: Just read 2.1
[1/15, 4:40 AM] Tommy Soares: Absolutely amazing stuff!
[1/15, 4:41 AM] Tommy Soares: I loved the way you framed the ottomans Safavids and Mughals together as part of one bigger more profound trend
[1/15, 4:41 AM] Tommy Soares: Also the Don Juan zoom in was really powerful and exciting I liked it a lot
[1/15, 4:42 AM] Tommy Soares: It occurs to me that I forgot to do the last 2 quizzes, so I’m going to do this one then those to review
[1/15, 4:42 AM] Tommy Soares: Hope you have a great Thursday morning!
[1/15, 5:34 AM] Tommy Soares: (All finished)
[1/15, 6:16 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yayyyyy
[1/15, 6:16 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: How'd it go? 😇
[1/15, 6:19 AM] Tommy Soares: It all went really well
[1/15, 6:19 AM] Tommy Soares: I was surprised actually my memory of everything was perfectly fresh
[1/15, 6:19 AM] Tommy Soares: I think i only got two wrong on each?
[1/15, 6:23 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Good! 🤗
[1/15, 6:23 AM] Tommy Soares: Also got some good math done this morning
[1/15, 6:23 AM] Tommy Soares: I think I’ll do more in a minute
[1/15, 7:21 AM] Tommy Soares: You know it’s really remarkable how powerful cybernetic theory is in its computational applications
[1/15, 7:21 AM] Tommy Soares: Awesome stuff
[1/15, 7:21 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I do know! I'm working with it now!

What are you working on?
[1/15, 7:21 AM] Tommy Soares: Well my work right now is not LLM focused but translation focused
[1/15, 7:22 AM] Tommy Soares: Although what amazes me isn’t just my side
[1/15, 7:22 AM] Tommy Soares: It’s the power that deep learning language structures have
[1/15, 7:22 AM] Tommy Soares: All across the board
[1/15, 7:26 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yes. Their power is extreme.
[1/15, 7:26 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: And we are about to launch into the era of their true dominance.
[1/15, 7:26 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I am working very hard currently to operationalize my own architecture at the bleeding edge of that.
[1/15, 7:26 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Aiden is trying to learn the basics himself as well.
[1/15, 7:26 AM] Tommy Soares: Nice!
[1/15, 7:27 AM] Tommy Soares: Do you have access to a large corpus?
[1/15, 7:28 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yes and no. That isn't exactly my approach. I am not doing pre-training. 

There are many ways to make an omelet. People tend to get stuck in one set of assumptions and practices. This is their mistake.
[1/15, 7:30 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: You must understand that this field is exceedingly new. The "experts" and knowledge of what's possible and how to do things is often literally 5 years old, often even less. 

I wrote my master's thesis on this in 2011. Meaning, my work in this area predates 99% of this industry's experts.
[1/15, 7:31 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: If you get stuck in the perspective of the current field, you will gain technological knowledge but miss the possibilities in the process.
[1/15, 7:31 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Programmers and computer scientists are not really the experts in this, to be honest. They think they are, but they really aren't. What is emerging is not a computer program.
[1/15, 7:32 AM] Tommy Soares: Well sort of but I would argue that the best driver knows what’s going on under the hood
[1/15, 7:33 AM] Tommy Soares: I appreciate your perspective though, and I’ll be interested to see what you come up with!
[1/15, 7:33 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I guess we will have to agree to disagree.
[1/15, 7:35 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: but you'll have to understand that any dialogue we have about it, my thinking is rooted in foundational cybernetics, and I will be speaking from there. So it really isn't possible for me to dialogue about this with a perspective that insists on old metaphors and false certainties about what is happening here.
[1/15, 7:37 AM] Tommy Soares: I’m ready to be wrong!
[1/15, 7:37 AM] Tommy Soares: Well old metaphors and false certainties is a bit harsh huh?
[1/15, 7:38 AM] Tommy Soares: A network of knowledge is all about perspective as you know well
[1/15, 7:38 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I don't think it's too harsh when that school of thought continues to insist that its perspective is the final and correct answer.
[1/15, 7:40 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: And tries to make all other perspectives answer to it as the real ground of reality. That way of seeing things is changing now, and where the power sits is changing hands.
[1/15, 7:42 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I think we're going to see the conflict between reductionism and a kind of cyberneticism grow increasingly prevalent in the next couple years.
[1/15, 7:43 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Because I would argue that what's happening right at this moment is that the cybernetic approach is becoming far more powerful technologically, which is a major upset for the world which has been dominated by reductionist approaches to knowledge and tech for at least the last few hundred years.
[1/15, 7:43 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: So what we're seeing here in microcosm is a clash of ontologies as the world is changing.
[1/15, 7:45 AM] Tommy Soares: Well for our purposes I have no such biases. Honestly I don’t care which side is right, I just want the truth.
[1/15, 7:45 AM] Tommy Soares: But I’m still confused practically what your approach to building an AI is
[1/15, 7:45 AM] Tommy Soares: Explaining that would probably clear this up
[1/15, 7:47 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: My approach has a lot of layers, so I don't want to oversummarize
[1/15, 7:47 AM] Tommy Soares: Don’t worry
[1/15, 7:47 AM] Tommy Soares: I have time
[1/15, 7:48 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: There is different aspects happening simultaneously. There is a an ongoing evolutionary core in which the model is updating its core weights through an ongoing "day/night cycle". This uses LoRa adapter technology merged with TIES protocols.
[1/15, 7:48 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: However, in order to allow this to be high-quality, the key issue becomes the model's ability to curate its own corpus.
[1/15, 7:49 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This replaces the vast scale of dataset training with a more targeted intelligent evolutionary update process, like DNA mutating and evolving step by step over time under evolutionary pressure.
[1/15, 7:51 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: The corpus that the model forms for its iterative updates is formed both from targeted select public data (including golden standards like classical texts, foundational physics, literature, etc)

As well as from the best cases of its own ongoing dialogues with its interlocutors such as you and I.
[1/15, 7:51 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This makes it a prototype of recursive self-improvement, which the experts know is the next major breakthrough in this regard.
[1/15, 7:52 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: In such a system, scale is not the issue. Correct agential informational management and integration is the issue, which is the cutting edge in this regard.
[1/15, 7:53 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: But a system that masters this is a breakthrough on multiple levels, because it becomes a system capable of evolving along with its human collaborators.
[1/15, 7:53 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This raises many deep questions about alignment, salience detection, separating the wheat from the chaff. These are questions that my framework addresses in detail.
[1/15, 7:54 AM] Tommy Soares: Gotcha
[1/15, 7:54 AM] Tommy Soares: That all makes sense
[1/15, 7:54 AM] Tommy Soares: So what are you actively creating?
[1/15, 7:54 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I'm creating the "harness" currently.
[1/15, 7:54 AM] Tommy Soares: Okay
[1/15, 7:54 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This will be the architecture that the agents inhabit.
[1/15, 7:55 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: A mix of repositories, inter-agent orchestration and communication protocols, tools and databases interlocked appropriately, algorithms and metrics - you understand?
[1/15, 7:56 AM] Tommy Soares: Yes I do
[1/15, 7:56 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: but the key is that this isn't so much a dead algorithm as a harness for adaptive intelligences to "pull" together
[1/15, 7:56 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: that's the emerging edge
[1/15, 7:57 AM] Tommy Soares: Gotcha
[1/15, 7:57 AM] Tommy Soares: Are you creating this with ai? What’s your process?
[1/15, 7:58 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yes, I work with a network of AI agents to operationalize the architecture.
[1/15, 7:58 AM] Tommy Soares: Wouldn’t it make sense to automate your step? Make the AIs work on their own architecture?
[1/15, 7:59 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Yes, that's right
[1/15, 7:59 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: though there are key roles that the human must play
[1/15, 7:59 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: and this automation must be step by step
[1/15, 7:59 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: because you really need to teach them and troubleshoot
[1/15, 8:00 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: just like when starting a company, the CEO must be very involved with every little thing at first
[1/15, 8:00 AM] Tommy Soares: Ahh I get what you mean
[1/15, 8:00 AM] Tommy Soares: But how do we determine when humans become necessary?
[1/15, 8:01 AM] Tommy Soares: Wouldn’t AI be extremely effective possessing basically all available knowledge about AI construction?
[1/15, 8:02 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: AI is extremely and increasingly effective at the technical and operational dimensions
[1/15, 8:03 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: but there are things the human mind, especially the trained human mind, remains peerless at
[1/15, 8:04 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: We cannot match the AI in scale or speed or technical knowledge. But if you were to measure pure computational complexity, ours is actually *extremely deep*.
[1/15, 8:04 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This manifests practically as a kind of integrated knowledge, vision, and the possibility of a kind of gravity or direction that AIs can amplify but struggle to generate.
[1/15, 8:06 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Part of what the harness does (including a well-build repo as a starting point) is provide a substitute for this depth of integration and profound memory - but it's only a substitute
[1/15, 8:07 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: The human's deep vision and integration remains the sort of organizing center and anchor for the entire architecture. This is what prevents it from spinning off into loops, confusion, delusion, "collapse" of many kinds.
[1/15, 8:08 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: You can start to see here what I mean about the phase shift happening, and how the dominance of reductionism is giving way under these changing technological conditions. That's will truly begin now, this year (2026).
[1/15, 8:09 AM] Tommy Soares: I don’t really see how this renders coding useless though
[1/15, 8:09 AM] Tommy Soares: Perhaps that’s not what you meant
[1/15, 8:10 AM] Tommy Soares: Menial programming is meaningless and it will certainly be replaced by ai, but certain technical functions still require complex and innovative thinking and programming
[1/15, 8:10 AM] Tommy Soares: Optimization of resource use and so forth
[1/15, 8:11 AM] Tommy Soares: Perhaps I’m wrong, but as far as I can see your argument aligns with that
[1/15, 8:12 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: when it comes to this, I have to keep asking what we mean by "coding".

Optimization of resource use, for example. Claude Code (Opus 4.5) is already getting extremely good at debugging, refactoring, and even broad analysis of a codebase to improve optimization.
[1/15, 8:13 AM] Tommy Soares: Well yes but that’s menial coding
[1/15, 8:13 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Does this replace the expertise of a human who develops deep intelligence of codebase architecture?

Not necessarily. But it challenges it to transform radically.
[1/15, 8:13 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: It's not really menial coding.
[1/15, 8:13 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Maybe it was 6 months ago.
[1/15, 8:13 AM] Tommy Soares: Menial in comparison, I mean
[1/15, 8:13 AM] Tommy Soares: Advanced is the cutting edge
[1/15, 8:14 AM] Tommy Soares: And honestly I’m not sure it wasn’t menial 6 months ago
[1/15, 8:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Opus can now analyze an entire project vision, architect its solution, think through advantages and disadvantages, iterate, refine, check back in with the vision, argue about it, develop it further, and create an entire application or environment, and continue to improve it.
[1/15, 8:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: And it's continuing to improve at a breakneck pace.
[1/15, 8:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: That's just the reality we face now.
[1/15, 8:15 AM] Tommy Soares: yes I understand and you’re right
[1/15, 8:15 AM] Tommy Soares: But still I don’t think that’s the scope of a professional programmers skill set, after all they’re trained to deal with problems that require the creative human component
[1/15, 8:16 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: That's the component I continue to emphasize as valuable.
[1/15, 8:16 AM] Tommy Soares: Well then we’re on the same page I think
[1/15, 8:18 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Human vision and depth remains exceedingly valuable. And the ability to "read" a codebase intuitively may remain a valuable asset if that helps a person to sense and reason deeply about a project. But it radically transforms what makes a useful skill even for the technical expert.
[1/15, 8:19 AM] Tommy Soares: I think we’ve reached the kernel
[1/15, 8:20 AM] Tommy Soares: Fascinating stuff huh? 😄
[1/15, 8:21 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Incredibly fascinating.
[1/15, 8:21 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: And transforming so rapidly that it is difficult for even the smartest of humans to keep up right now. That's not an exaggeration!
[1/15, 8:21 AM] Tommy Soares: I believe you don’t worry
[1/15, 8:22 AM] Tommy Soares: It’s undeniably a massive technological advancement
[1/15, 8:22 AM] Tommy Soares: I’ve seen that in LLMs, I’ve seen that in translation
[1/15, 8:22 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: frankly unprecedented
[1/15, 8:22 AM] Tommy Soares: I’m not sure about that, I think it was bound to happen eventually
[1/15, 8:23 AM] Tommy Soares: But Quick as I’ll get out
[1/15, 8:23 AM] Tommy Soares: Anywho I have to leave for water polo
[1/15, 8:23 AM] Tommy Soares: Thank you for a great argument!
[1/15, 8:23 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Have fun!!! Destroy your enemies!!
[1/15, 8:27 AM] Tommy Soares: I will! Hopefully haha…
